Impacts on human and natural systems are expected to increase with further warming and some may be irreversible. Yet impacts under policy-relevant stabilization or overshoot pathways have not been well quantified. Here we report the risks of irreversible impacts on forest ecosystems, such as Amazon forest loss and high-latitude woody encroachment, under three scenarios that explore low levels of exceedance and overshoot beyond 1.5 °C. Long-term forest loss is mitigated by reducing global temperatures below 1.5 °C. The proximity of dieback risk thresholds to the bounds of the Paris Agreement global warming levels underscores the need for urgent action to mitigate climate change—and the risks of irreversible loss of an important ecosystem.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chim_neglecting_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Neglecting future sporadic volcanic eruptions underestimates climate uncertainty</div> <div class="author"> Man Mei Chim, Thomas J.

Here we show that the contribution of volcanic forcing uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in global mean surface air temperature projections reaches up to 49% in 2029, and is comparable or greater than that from internal variability throughout the 21st century. Furthermore, compared to a constant volcanic forcing, employing a stochastic volcanic forcing reduces the probability of exceeding 1.5 °C warming above pre-industrial level by at least 5% for high climate mitigation scenario, and enhances the probability of negative decadal temperature trends by up to 8%. Intermediate to high climate mitigation scenarios are particularly sensitive to the choice of future volcanic forcing implementation. We recommend the use of either a stochastic approach or prescribed constant forcing levels that sample volcanic uncertainty in future climate simulations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="pelz_using_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Using net-zero carbon debt to track climate overshoot responsibility</div> <div class="author"> Setu Pelz, Gaurav Ganti, Robin Lamboll, Luke Grant, <em>Chris Smith</em>, Shonali Pachauri, Joeri Rogelj, Keywan Riahi, Wim Thiery, and Matthew J.

To clarify responsibilities for this budget exceedance, we consider “net-zero carbon debt,” a forward-looking measure of the extent to which a party is expected to breach its “fair share” of the remaining budget by the time it achieves net-zero carbon emissions. We apply this measure to all vetted mitigation scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report and two scenarios that model current policies and pledges, using an illustrative equal per capita allocation of a remaining 1.5 °C carbon budget starting in 1990. The resulting regional carbon debt estimates inform i) the scale and pace of regional carbon drawdown obligations necessary to address budget exceedance and ii) relative regional responsibilities for increased lifetime exposure to extreme heatwaves across age cohorts due to budget exceedance. Our work strengthens intergenerational equity considerations within an international climate equity discourse and informs the implementation of effort-sharing mechanisms that persist beyond the exhaustion of a rapidly dwindling remaining carbon budget. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mathison_prime_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A rapid-application emissions-to-impacts tool for scenario assessment: Probabilistic Regional Impacts from Model patterns and Emissions (PRIME)</div> <div class="author"> C.

Simple climate models are extremely efficient, although some can only provide global estimates of climate metrics such as mean surface temperature, CO2 concentration and effective radiative forcing. Within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework, understanding of the regional impacts of scenarios that include the most recent science is needed to allow targeted policy decisions to be made quickly. To address this, we present PRIME (Probabilistic Regional Impacts from Model patterns and Emissions), a new flexible probabilistic framework which aims to provide an efficient mechanism to run new scenarios without the significant overheads of larger, more complex Earth system models (ESMs). PRIME provides the capability to include features of the most recent ESM projections, science and scenarios to run ensemble simulations on multi-centennial timescales and include analyses of many key variables that are relevant and important for impact assessments. We use a simple climate model to provide the global temperature response to emissions scenarios. These estimated temperatures are used to scale monthly mean patterns from a large number of CMIP6 ESMs. These patterns provide the inputs to a “weather generator” algorithm and a land surface model. The PRIME system thus generates an end-to-end estimate of the land surface impacts from the emissions scenarios. We test PRIME using known scenarios in the form of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), to demonstrate that our model reproduces the ESM climate responses to these scenarios. We show results for a range of scenarios: the SSP5–8.5 high-emissions scenario was used to define the patterns, and SSP1–2.6, a mitigation scenario with low emissions, and SSP5–3.4-OS, an overshoot scenario, were used as verification data. PRIME correctly represents the climate response (and spread) for these known scenarios, which gives us confidence our simulation framework will be useful for rapidly providing probabilistic spatially resolved information for novel climate scenarios, thereby substantially reducing the time between new scenarios being released and the availability of regional impact information.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="storelvmo_assessing_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing the robustness and implications of econometric estimates of climate sensitivity</div> <div class="author"> Trude Storelvmo, Menghan Yuan, Thomas Leirvik, Kari Alterskjær, Peter C B Phillips, and <em>Chris Smith</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, Feb 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adabfc" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adabfc" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1088/1748-9326/adabfc" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Earth’s transient climate response (TCR) quantifies the global mean surface air temperature change due to a doubling of atmospheric CO_2 concentration after 70 years of a compounding 1% per year increase. TCR is highly correlated with near-term climate projections, and thus of relevance for climate policy, but remains poorly constrained in part due to uncertainties in the representation of key physical processes in Earth System Models (ESMs). Within state-of-the-art ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the TCR range (1.1 °C–2.9 °C) is too wide to offer useful guidance to policymakers. Similarly, the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, while not solely reliant on ESMs for its TCR assessment, produced a very likely range of 1.2 °C–2.4 °C. To complement earlier, ESM-based, estimates, we here present a new TCR estimate of 2.17 (1.72–2.77) °C (95% confidence interval), derived based on a statistical relationship between surface air temperature and observational proxies for its main drivers, i.e. changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols. We show that, within uncertainty, this method correctly diagnoses TCR from 20 CMIP6 ESMs if the same input variables are taken from the ESMs that are available from observations. This increases confidence in the new observation-based central estimate and range, which is respectively higher and narrower than the mean and spread of the estimates from the entire ensemble of CMIP6. Many ESM-based estimates tend to produce TCRs lower than the observational range reported here. Our findings suggest that a misrepresentation of the aerosol cooling effect could be the cause of this discrepancy. Further, the revised TCR estimate suggests a downward revision of the remaining carbon budgets aligned with the overarching goal of the Paris agreement.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="pfleiderer_reversal_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Reversal of the impact chain for actionable climate information</div> <div class="author"> Peter Pfleiderer, Thomas L.

However, limitations in the provision of actionable climate information may hinder an anticipatory response. Here we suggest a reversal of the traditional impact chain methodology as an end-user focused approach linking specific climate risk thresholds, including at the local level, to emissions pathways. We outline the socioeconomic and value judgement dimensions that can inform the identification of such risk thresholds. The applicability of the approach is highlighted by three examples that estimate the required CO2 emissions constraints to avoid critical levels of health-related heat risks in Berlin, fire weather in Portugal and glacier mass loss in High Mountain Asia. We argue that linking risk threshold exceedance directly to global emissions benchmarks can aid the understanding of the benefits of stringent emissions reductions for societies and local decision-makers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="tsutsui_2025_revisiting" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Revisiting two-layer energy balance models for climate assessment</div> <div class="author"> Junichi Tsutsui, and <em>Chris Smith</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, Jan 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad9ec5" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad9ec5" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1088/1748-9326/ad9ec5" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Given the pivotal role of probabilistic approaches with two-layer energy balance models in the latest climate assessment, this study aims to gain deeper insight into their advancement by comparing different approaches for generating constrained posterior ensembles. Several methodological improvements are possible both in the calibration of model parameters to the behavior of comprehensive Earth system models and in constraining the calibrated parameter ensemble with other lines of evidence. The results imply that a conventional single parameter representing evolving climate feedback characteristics is not a requirement for reliable climate projections; rather, there are potential improvements on the forcing side regarding the separation of forcing and feedbacks. Constraining the ensemble based on observational and expert-assessed climate metrics, which critically affects probabilistic climate assessment, needs to appropriately deal with different constraints on a multivariate space in a standardized and flexible way.

Simple climate models (also known as emulators) have re-emerged as critical tools for the analysis of climate policy. Emulators are efficient and highly parameterised, where the parameters are tunable to produce a diversity of global mean surface temperature (GMST) response pathways to a given emission scenario. Only a small fraction of possible parameter combinations will produce historically consistent climate hindcasts, a necessary condition for trust in future projections. Alongside historical GMST, additional observed (e.g. ocean heat content) and emergent climate metrics (such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity) can be used as constraints upon the parameter sets used for climate projections. This paper describes a multi-variable constraining package for the Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) simple climate model (FaIR versions 2.1.0 onwards) using a Bayesian framework. The steps are, first, to generate prior distributions of parameters for FaIR based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) Earth system models or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-assessed ranges; second, to generate a large Monte Carlo prior ensemble of parameters to run FaIR with; and, third, to produce a posterior set of parameters constrained on several observable and assessed climate metrics. Different calibrations can be produced for different emission datasets or observed climate constraints, allowing version-controlled and continually updated calibrations to be produced. We show that two very different future projections to a given emission scenario can be obtained using emissions from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (fair-calibrate v1.4.0) and from updated emission datasets through 2022 (fair-calibrate v1.4.1) for similar climate constraints in both cases. fair-calibrate can be reconfigured for different source emission datasets or target climate distributions, and new versions will be produced upon availability of new climate system data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="friedlingstein_earth_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Earth system responses to different levels of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation</div> <div class="author"> Pierre Friedlingstein, Paulo Artaxo, Angela V.

Hence, future warming will primarily result from future emissions of CO2 with contributions from other greenhouse gases (mostly CH4 and N2O) and aerosols. Climate projections of the 21st century, such as those assessed by the IPCC, are provided from comprehensive climate models, also called Earth System models, driven by scenarios of the 21st century evolution of emissions from those climate forcers. While it seems now inevitable that the world will reach 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels by the early 2030s, the extent to which we exceed this warming level and how quickly we may be able to reduce temperatures again depends strongly on global activity taken now to limit emissions. In this paper, we review the current understanding on Earth system changes under two highly contrasted possible future worlds. We first focus on high-end scenarios, where anthropogenic emissions continue to increase over the course of the 21st century, leading to large warming levels, associated impacts on all components of the Earth System, and increased risks of triggering tipping points. We then assess low-end scenarios, where anthropogenic emissions rapidly decline, reaching net zero and potentially becoming net negative before the end of the 21st century. Such “overshoot” scenarios lead to a peak in global warming followed by a slow decline in global temperature, with some degree of reversibility in the global carbon cycle and key Earth system components. We also review paleoclimatic information relevant to these two contrasting future worlds. Paleoclimate evidence for geo-biosphere interactions shows that stabilizing feedbacks operate on millennial or longer timescales, whereas destabilizing feedbacks and tipping cascades occurred also on shorter timescales. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="sanderson_need_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The need for carbon-emissions-driven climate projections in CMIP7</div> <div class="author"> B.

We argue that although this approach was practical to allow parallel development of Earth system model simulations and detailed socioeconomic futures, carbon cycle uncertainty as represented by diverse, process-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) is not manifested in the scenario outcomes, thus omitting a dominant source of uncertainty in meeting the Paris Agreement. Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy, and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently calculated in integrated assessment models (IAMs) during scenario development with only the net carbon emissions passed to the ESM. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon–climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular, sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide) and process-based representation of carbon removal options. These developments will allow three primary benefits: (1) resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts, (2) scenario modeling of the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks that are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, and (3) optimal utilization of the strengths of ESMs in the wider context of climate modeling infrastructure (which includes simple climate models, machine learning approaches and kilometer-scale climate models).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="quaas_adjustments_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Adjustments to Climate Perturbations—Mechanisms, Implications, Observational Constraints</div> <div class="author"> Johannes Quaas, Timothy Andrews, Nicolas Bellouin, Karoline Block, Olivier Boucher, Paulo Ceppi, Guy Dagan, Sabine Doktorowski, Hannah Marie Eichholz, Piers Forster, Tom Goren, Edward Gryspeerdt, Øivind Hodnebrog, Hailing Jia, Ryan Kramer, Charlotte Lange, Amanda C.

Adjustments are defined as processes that occur in response to the introduction of a climate forcing agent, but that are independent of global‐mean surface temperature changes. Most considered are the adjustments that impact the Earth energy budget and strengthen or weaken the instantaneous radiative forcing due to the forcing agent. Some adjustment mechanisms also impact other aspects of climate not related to the Earth radiation budget. Since AR5 and a following description by Sherwood et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1175/bams‐d‐13‐00167.1 ), much research on adjustments has been performed and is reviewed here. We classify the adjustment mechanisms into six main categories, and discuss methods of quantifying these adjustments in terms of their potentials, shortcomings and practicality. We furthermore describe aspects of adjustments that act beyond the energetic framework, and we propose new ideas to observe adjustments or to make use of observations to constrain their representation in models. Altogether, the problem of adjustments is now on a robust scientific footing, and better quantification and observational constraint is possible. This allows for improvements in understanding and quantifying climate change. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="schleussner_overconfidence_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Overconfidence in climate overshoot</div> <div class="author"> Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Gaurav Ganti, Quentin Lejeune, Biqing Zhu, Peter Pfleiderer, Ruben Prütz, Philippe Ciais, Thomas L.

This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy 2–5 . Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming 6,7 . To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales 8,9 . Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="allen_present-day_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes surface warming relative to preindustrial conditions</div> <div class="author"> Robert J.

In particular, Allen et al. (2023) used idealized climate model simulations to show that methane shortwave absorption mutes up to 30 % of the surface warming and 60 % of the precipitation increase associated with its longwave radiative effects. Here, we explicitly quantify the radiative and climate impacts due to shortwave absorption of the present-day methane perturbation. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes the warming effects of longwave absorption. For example, the global mean cooling in response to the present-day methane shortwave absorption is -0.10±0.07 K, which offsets 28 % (7 %–55 %) of the surface warming associated with present-day methane longwave radiative effects. The precipitation increase associated with the longwave radiative effects of the present-day methane perturbation (0.012±0.006 mm d−1) is also muted by shortwave absorption but not significantly so (-0.008±0.009 mm d−1). The unique responses to methane shortwave absorption are related to its negative top-of-the-atmosphere effective radiative forcing but positive atmospheric heating and in part to methane’s distinctive vertical atmospheric solar heating profile. We also find that the present-day methane shortwave radiative effects, relative to its longwave radiative effects, are about 5 times larger than those under idealized carbon dioxide perturbations. Additional analyses show consistent but non-significant differences between the longwave versus shortwave radiative effects for both methane and carbon dioxide, including a stronger (negative) climate feedback when shortwave radiative effects are included (particularly for methane). We conclude by reiterating that methane remains a potent greenhouse gas.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="sarofim_high_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">High radiative forcing climate scenario relevance analyzed with a ten-million-member ensemble</div> <div class="author"> Marcus C.

With an atmospheric lifetime of around a decade, methane mitigation starting immediately has the potential to avoid substantial levels of additional warming by mid-century. In addition to the methane emissions reductions that are necessary to limit warming, we address the question of whether technological methane removal can provide additional benefits by avoiding global mean surface temperatures exceeding 1.5 ∘C above pre-industrial—the high-ambition Paris Agreement climate goal. Using an adaptive emissions methane removal routine in a simple climate model, we successfully limit peak warming to 1.5 ∘C for overshoots of up to around 0.3 ∘C. For substantially higher overshoots, methane removal alone is unable to limit warming to 1.5 ∘C, but in an extreme scenario could limit peak warming by an ensemble median 0.7 ∘C if all atmospheric methane was removed, requiring huge levels of net removal on the order of tens of petagrams cumulatively. The efficacy of methane removal depends on many emergent properties of the climate system, including climate sensitivity, aerosol forcing, and the committed warming after net zero CO2 (zero emissions commitment). To avoid overshooting 1.5 ∘C in the low-overshoot, strong-mitigation SSP1-1.9 scenario, a median cumulative methane removal of 1.2 PgCH4 is required, though this may be much higher if climate sensitivity is high or the zero emissions commitment is positive, and in these cases may require ongoing methane removal long after peak warming in order to stabilise warming below 1.5 ∘C.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="forster_indicators_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Indicators of Global Climate Change 2023: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence</div> <div class="author"> Piers M.

Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth’s energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014–2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] °C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] °C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] °C in 2023 relative to 1850–1900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] °C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53±5.4 Gt CO2e yr−1 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="myhre_efficacy_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Efficacy of climate forcings in transient CMIP6 simulations</div> <div class="author"> Gunnar Myhre, Rachael E.

Typically, this ratio is divided by the same ratio for CO 2 and termed efficacy. Previously it has been shown that efficacy is close to unity in abrupt perturbation experiments for a range of climate drivers, but efficacy with respect to CO 2 has not been investigated in transient realistic simulations. Here, we analyse transient simulations from CMIP6 experiments and show comparable results between transient and abrupt perturbation experiments. We demonstrate that aerosol efficacy is not significantly different from unity, however inter-model differences in aerosol experiments are notably large.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="meinshausen_perspective_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A perspective on the next generation of Earth system model scenarios: towards representative emission pathways (REPs)</div> <div class="author"> Malte Meinshausen, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Kathleen Beyer, Greg Bodeker, Olivier Boucher, Josep G.

Within the reports, the ambition is to integrate knowledge on possible climate futures across the Working Groups and scientific research domains based on a small set of “framing pathways” such as the so-called representative concentration pathways (RCPs) in the Fifth IPCC Assessment Report (AR5) and the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This perspective, initiated by discussions at the IPCC Bangkok workshop in April 2023 on the “Use of Scenarios in AR6 and Subsequent Assessments”, is intended to serve as one of the community contributions to highlight the needs for the next generation of framing pathways that is being advanced under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) umbrella, which will influence or even predicate the IPCC AR7 consideration of framing pathways. Here we suggest several policy research objectives that such a set of framing pathways should ideally fulfil, including mitigation needs for meeting the Paris Agreement objectives, the risks associated with carbon removal strategies, the consequences of delay in enacting that mitigation, guidance for adaptation needs, loss and damage, and for achieving mitigation in the wider context of societal development goals. Based on this context, we suggest that the next generation of climate scenarios for Earth system models should evolve towards representative emission pathways (REPs) and suggest key categories for such pathways. These framing pathways should address the most critical mitigation policy and adaptation plans that need to be implemented over the next 10 years. In our view, the most important categories are those relevant in the context of the Paris Agreement long-term goal, specifically an immediate action (low overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway and a delayed action (high overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway. Two other key categories are a pathway category approximately in line with current (as expressed by 2023) near- and long-term policy objectives, as well as a higher-emission category that is approximately in line with “current policies” (as expressed by 2023). We also argue for the scientific and policy relevance in exploring two “worlds that could have been”. One of these categories has high-emission trajectories well above what is implied by current policies and the other has very-low-emission trajectories which assume that global mitigation action in line with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshoot had begun in 2015. Finally, we note that the timely provision of new scientific information on pathways is critical to inform the development and implementation of climate policy. Under the Paris Agreement, for the second global stocktake, which will occur in 2028, and to inform subsequent development of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) up to 2040, scientific inputs are required by 2027. These needs should be carefully considered in the development timeline of community modelling activities, including those under CMIP7.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="fiedler_interactions_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Interactions between atmospheric composition and climate change – progress in understanding and future opportunities from AerChemMIP, PDRMIP, and RFMIP</div> <div class="author"> Stephanie Fiedler, Vaishali Naik, Fiona M.

Yet not all climate interactions are fully understood, and uncertainty in climate model results persists, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We synthesize current challenges and emphasize opportunities for advancing our understanding of the interactions between atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate change, as well as for quantifying model diversity. Our perspective is based on expert views from three multi-model intercomparison projects (MIPs) – the Precipitation Driver Response MIP (PDRMIP), the Aerosol Chemistry MIP (AerChemMIP), and the Radiative Forcing MIP (RFMIP). While there are many shared interests and specializations across the MIPs, they have their own scientific foci and specific approaches. The partial overlap between the MIPs proved useful for advancing the understanding of the perturbation–response paradigm through multi-model ensembles of Earth system models of varying complexity. We discuss the challenges of gaining insights from Earth system models that face computational and process representation limits and provide guidance from our lessons learned. Promising ideas to overcome some long-standing challenges in the near future are kilometer-scale experiments to better simulate circulation-dependent processes where it is possible and machine learning approaches where they are needed, e.g., for faster and better subgrid-scale parameterizations and pattern recognition in big data. New model constraints can arise from augmented observational products that leverage multiple datasets with machine learning approaches. Future MIPs can develop smart experiment protocols that strive towards an optimal trade-off between the resolution, complexity, and number of simulations and their length and, thereby, help to advance the understanding of climate change and its impacts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="weber_chemistry-albedo_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Chemistry-albedo feedbacks offset up to a third of forestation’s CO2 removal benefits</div> <div class="author"> James Weber, James A.

We found that forestation increased aerosol scattering and the greenhouse gases methane and ozone following increased biogenic organic emissions. Additionally, forestation decreased surface albedo, which yielded a positive radiative forcing (i.e., warming). This offset up to a third of the negative forcing from the additional CO 2 removal under a 4°C warming scenario. However, when forestation was pursued alongside other strategies that achieve the 2°C Paris Agreement target, the offsetting positive forcing was smaller, highlighting the urgency for simultaneous emission reductions. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="kopp_framework_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) v1.0: a platform for characterizing parametric and structural uncertainty in future global, relative, and extreme sea-level change</div> <div class="author"> Robert E.

Future sea-level rise projections are characterized by both quantifiable uncertainty and unquantifiable structural uncertainty. Thorough scientific assessment of sea-level rise projections requires analysis of both dimensions of uncertainty. Probabilistic sea-level rise projections evaluate the quantifiable dimension of uncertainty; comparison of alternative probabilistic methods provides an indication of structural uncertainty. Here we describe the Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS), a modular platform for characterizing different probability distributions for the drivers of sea-level change and their consequences for global mean, regional, and extreme sea-level change. We demonstrate its application by generating seven alternative probability distributions under multiple emissions scenarios for both future global mean sea-level change and future relative and extreme sea-level change at New York City. These distributions, closely aligned with those presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, emphasize the role of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets as drivers of structural uncertainty in sea-level change projections.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lamboll_assessing_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing the size and uncertainty of remaining carbon budgets</div> <div class="author"> Robin D.

RCB estimates for 1.5 °C are small, and minor changes in their calculation can therefore result in large relative adjustments. Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and present more recent data, calculation refinements and robustness checks that increase confidence in them. We conclude that the RCB for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5 °C is around 250 GtCO2 as of January 2023, equal to around six years of current CO2 emissions. For a 50% chance of 2 °C the RCB is around 1,200 GtCO2. Key uncertainties affecting RCB estimates are the contribution of non-CO2 emissions, which depends on socioeconomic projections as much as on geophysical uncertainty, and potential warming after net zero CO2.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="linke_constraints_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Constraints on simulated past Arctic amplification and lapse rate feedback from observations</div> <div class="author"> Olivia Linke, Johannes Quaas, Finja Baumer, Sebastian Becker, Jan Chylik, Sandro Dahlke, André Ehrlich, Dörthe Handorf, Christoph Jacobi, Heike Kalesse-Los, Luca Lelli, Sina Mehrdad, Roel A.

The Arctic has warmed more rapidly than the global mean during the past few decades. The lapse rate feedback (LRF) has been identified as being a large contributor to the Arctic amplification (AA) of climate change. This particular feedback arises from the vertically non-uniform warming of the troposphere, which in the Arctic emerges as strong near-surface and muted free-tropospheric warming. Stable stratification and meridional energy transport are two characteristic processes that are evoked as causes for this vertical warming structure. Our aim is to constrain these governing processes by making use of detailed observations in combination with the large climate model ensemble of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We build on the result that CMIP6 models show a large spread in AA and Arctic LRF, which are positively correlated for the historical period of 1951–2014. Thus, we present process-oriented constraints by linking characteristics of the current climate to historical climate simulations. In particular, we compare a large consortium of present-day observations to co-located model data from subsets that show a weak and strong simulated AA and Arctic LRF in the past. Our analyses suggest that the vertical temperature structure of the Arctic boundary layer is more realistically depicted in climate models with weak (w) AA and Arctic LRF (CMIP6/w) in the past. In particular, CMIP6/w models show stronger inversions in the present climate for boreal autumn and winter and over sea ice, which is more consistent with the observations. These results are based on observations from the year-long Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in the central Arctic, long-term measurements at the Utqiaġvik site in Alaska, USA, and dropsonde temperature profiling from aircraft campaigns in the Fram Strait. In addition, the atmospheric energy transport from lower latitudes that can further mediate the warming structure in the free troposphere is more realistically represented by CMIP6/w models. In particular, CMIP6/w models systemically simulate a weaker Arctic atmospheric energy transport convergence in the present climate for boreal autumn and winter, which is more consistent with fifth generation reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5). We further show a positive relationship between the magnitude of the present-day transport convergence and the strength of past AA. With respect to the Arctic LRF, we find links between the changes in transport pathways that drive vertical warming structures and local differences in the LRF. This highlights the mediating influence of advection on the Arctic LRF and motivates deeper studies to explicitly link spatial patterns of Arctic feedbacks to changes in the large-scale circulation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="zelinka_comparison_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Comparison of methods to estimate aerosol effective radiative forcings in climate models</div> <div class="author"> Mark D.

Uncertainty in the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of climate primarily arises from the unknown contribution of aerosols, which impact radiative fluxes directly and through modifying cloud properties. Climate model simulations with fixed sea surface temperatures but perturbed atmospheric aerosol loadings allow for an estimate of how strongly the planet’s radiative energy budget has been perturbed by the increase in aerosols since pre-industrial times. The approximate partial radiative perturbation (APRP) technique further decomposes the contributions to the direct forcing due to aerosol scattering and absorption and to the indirect forcing due to aerosol-induced changes in cloud scattering, amount, and absorption, as well as the effects of aerosols on surface albedo. Here we evaluate previously published APRP-derived estimates of aerosol effective radiative forcings from these simulations conducted in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and find that they are biased as a result of two large coding errors that – in most cases – fortuitously compensate. The most notable exception is the direct radiative forcing from absorbing aerosols, which is more than 40 % larger averaged across CMIP6 models in the present study. Correcting these biases eliminates the residuals and leads to better agreement with benchmark estimates derived from double calls to the radiation code. The APRP method – when properly implemented – remains a highly accurate and efficient technique for diagnosing aerosol ERF in cases where double radiation calls are not available, and in all cases it provides quantification of the individual contributors to the ERF that are highly useful but not otherwise available.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="fiedler_historical_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Historical Changes and Reasons for Model Differences in Anthropogenic Aerosol Forcing in CMIP6</div> <div class="author"> Stephanie Fiedler, Twan Van Noije, <em>Christopher J.

We find little changes in the aerosol ERF for 1970–2014 in the CMIP6 multi‐model mean, which implies greenhouse gases primarily explain the positive trend in the total anthropogenic ERF. Cloud‐mediated effects dominate the present‐day aerosol ERF in most models. The results highlight a regional increase in marine cloudiness due to aerosols, despite suppressed cloud lifetime effects in that RFMIP‐SpAer experiment. Negative cloud‐mediated effects mask positive direct effects in many models, which arise from strong anthropogenic aerosol absorption.

We use a well-known cost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty in FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically observed climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed ranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). By varying discounting assumptions, three scenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the ‘optimal welfare’ scenario of DICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that limit warming to ‘well-below’ 2 and 1.5 with a short-term overshoot, aiming to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals. Climate uncertainty alone is responsible for a factor of five variation (5%–95% range) in the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the 1.5 overshoot scenario, with the spread in SCC increasing in relative terms with increasing stringency of climate target. CO2 emissions trajectories resulting from the optimal level of emissions abatement in all pathways are also sensitive to climate uncertainty, with 2050 emissions ranging from −12 to +14 GtCO2 yr−1 in the 1.5 scenario. ECS and the strength of present-day aerosol effective radiative forcing are strong determinants of SCC and mid-century CO2 emissions. This shows that narrowing climate uncertainty leads to more refined estimates for the social cost of carbon and provides more certainty about the optimal rate of emissions abatement. Including climate and climate uncertainty in integrated assessment model derived emissions scenarios would address a key missing feedback in scenario construction.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="forster_indicators_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update of large-scale indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence</div> <div class="author"> P.

Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, surface temperature changes, the Earth’s energy imbalance, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192, Smith et al., 2023a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that human-induced warming reached 1.14 [0.9 to 1.4] ∘C averaged over the 2013–2022 decade and 1.26 [1.0 to 1.6] ∘C in 2022. Over the 2013–2022 period, human-induced warming has been increasing at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2 ∘C per decade. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.3 GtCO2e over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for human influence on climate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="allen_surface_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Surface warming and wetting due to methane’s long-wave radiative effects muted by short-wave absorption</div> <div class="author"> Robert J.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of methane short-wave absorption, which enhances its stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing by up to ~ 15%. The corresponding climate impacts, however, have been only indirectly evaluated and thus remain largely unquantified. Here we present a systematic, unambiguous analysis using one model and separate simulations with and without methane short-wave absorption. We find that methane short-wave absorption counteracts ~30% of the surface warming associated with its long-wave radiative effects. An even larger impact occurs for precipitation as methane short-wave absorption offsets ~60% of the precipitation increase relative to its long-wave radiative effects. The methane short-wave-induced cooling is due largely to cloud rapid adjustments, including increased low-level clouds, which enhance the reflection of incoming short-wave radiation, and decreased high-level clouds, which enhance outgoing long-wave radiation. The cloud responses, in turn, are related to the profile of atmospheric solar heating and corresponding changes in temperature and relative humidity. Despite our findings, methane remains a potent contributor to global warming, and efforts to reduce methane emissions are vital for keeping global warming well below 2 °C above preindustrial values.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cael_energy_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Energy budget diagnosis of changing climate feedback</div> <div class="author"> B.

It is thought to have been more negative in recent decades due to a sea surface temperature “pattern effect,” whereby warming is concentrated in the western tropical Pacific, where nonlocal radiative feedbacks are very negative. This phenomenon has however primarily been studied within climate models. We diagnose a pattern effect from historical records as an evolution of the climate feedback over the past five decades. Our analysis assumes a constant rate of change of the climate feedback, which is justified post hoc. We find a decrease in climate feedback by 0.8 ± 0.5 W m-2 K-1 over the past 50 years, corresponding to a reduction in climate sensitivity. Earth system models’ climate feedbacks instead increase over this period. Understanding and simulating this historical trend and its future evolution are critical for reliable climate projections. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="fredriksen_21st_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">21st Century Scenario Forcing Increases More for CMIP6 Than CMIP5 Models</div> <div class="author"> Hege‐Beate Fredriksen, <em>Christopher J.

We present new estimates of ERF for models participating in CMIP6 by applying the method developed in Fredriksen et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD034145), and validate our approach with available fixed‐SST forcing estimates. We estimate ERF for experiments with abrupt changes of CO2, 1% increase of CO2, historical forcings, and future scenarios, and demonstrate that CMIP6 ERF is lower than CMIP5 ERF at the end of the historical period, but grows faster than CMIP5 in the future scenarios, ending up at higher levels than CMIP5 at the end of the 21st century. The simulated radiative efficiency of CO2 has not changed much, suggesting that the larger future increase in CO2 concentrations in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 is important for explaining the forcing difference. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="sigmond_large_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Large Contribution of Ozone‐Depleting Substances to Global and Arctic Warming in the Late 20th Century</div> <div class="author"> M.

Analyzing all‐but‐one‐forcing, 20‐member ensembles of historical simulations with a state‐of‐the‐art Earth System Model, we find that over the 1955–2005 period ODSs are responsible for 30% of global warming, 37% of Arctic warming, and 33% of summertime Arctic sea ice loss. Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) calculations reveal that the global warming response to ODSs per unit of ERF is about 20% larger than for CO 2 , which may be due to stronger feedbacks and the difference in temporal evolution with ODSs having leveled off and CO 2 still increasing in 2005. While the response to both peaks in the Arctic, the ODS ERF opposes Arctic amplification more than the CO 2 ERF.

Polluting fuels also emit short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and grid-based electricity are scalable alternatives to polluting fuels but have raised climate and health concerns. Here, we compare emissions and climate impacts of a business-as-usual household cooking fuel trajectory to four large-scale transitions to gas and/or grid electricity in 77 LMICs. We account for upstream and end-use emissions from gas and electric cooking, assuming electrical grids evolve according to the 2022 World Energy Outlook’s ‘Stated Policies’ Scenario. We input the emissions into a reduced-complexity climate model to estimate radiative forcing and temperature changes associated with each scenario. We find full transitions to LPG and/or electricity decrease emissions from both well-mixed GHG and SLCFs, resulting in a roughly 5 millikelvin global temperature reduction by 2040. Transitions to LPG and/or electricity also reduce annual emissions of PM 2.5 by over 6 Mt (99%) by 2040, which would substantially lower health risks from household air pollution. Full transitions to LPG or grid electricity in LMICs improve climate impacts over BAU trajectories.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="rainard_gender_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Gender equality and climate change mitigation: Are women a secret weapon?</div> <div class="author"> Mathilde Rainard, <em>Christopher J.

However, the gender-climate nexus literature often disregards feminist epistemology, detrimentally integrating harmful gendered assumptions within its analyses, and therefore policy recommendations. To remedy this, links between gender equality and climate change mitigation action were investigated, through a mixed-method approach, which includes feminist theories. Two metrics of gender equity, the Global Gender Gap Index and the Gender Inequality Index, and their correlations to a sustainability metric, the Environmental Performance Index, were analyzed. This quantitative analysis was enriched by 13 interviews with gender-climate experts. Results showed that, despite statistically significant correlations between both gender equality indices and the Environmental Performance Index, the positive relationship between gender equality and environmental performances is contextual and multi-faceted. Disregarding situated gender constructs, understanding gender as binary, and positing women as a homogeneous group, all mask multiple interactions between gender equality and climate change mitigation. Unveiling these interactions necessitates better integration of radical gender theories within climate change science through interdisciplinary research, permitting epistemological pluralism. To further this, a methodological framework is proposed, to help guide environmental researchers willing to consider gender in their work. Furthermore, the impact of gender mainstreaming within climate policies is explored, presenting subsequent policy recommendations. Finally, findings and the systemic transformation potential of gender equality, amongst other forms of equality, are discussed, reinforcing the idea that there is no climate justice without gender justice, and that justice and equality are cornerstones of sustainable societies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ganti_uncompensated_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Uncompensated claims to fair emission space risk putting Paris Agreement goals out of reach</div> <div class="author"> Gaurav Ganti, Matthew J Gidden, Christopher J Smith, Claire Fyson, Alexander Nauels, Keywan Riahi, and Carl-Friedrich Schleußner </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, Feb 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acb502" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acb502" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="142240642"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1088/1748-9326/acb502" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Addressing questions of equitable contributions to emission reductions is important to facilitate ambitious global action on climate change within the ambit of the Paris Agreement. Several large developing regions with low historical contributions to global warming have a strong moral claim to a large proportion of the remaining carbon budget (RCB). However, this claim needs to be assessed in a context where the RCB consistent with the long-term temperature goal (LTTG) of the Paris Agreement is rapidly diminishing. Here we assess the potential tension between the moral claim to the remaining carbon space by large developing regions with low per capita emissions, and the collective obligation to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Based on scenarios underlying the IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report, we construct a suite of scenarios that combine the following elements: (a) two quantifications of a moral claim to the remaining carbon space by South Asia, and Africa, (b) a ‘highest possible emission reduction’ effort by developed regions (DRs), and (c) a corresponding range for other developing regions (ODR). We find that even the best effort by DRs cannot compensate for a unilateral claim to the remaining carbon space by South Asia and Africa. This would put the LTTG firmly out of reach unless ODRs cede their moral claim to emissions space and, like DRs, pursue highest possible emission reductions, which would also constitute an inequitable outcome. Furthermore, regions such as Latin America would need to provide large-scale negative emissions with potential risks and negative side effects. Our findings raise important questions of perspectives on equity in the context of the Paris Agreement including on the critical importance of climate finance. A failure to provide adequate levels of financial support to compensate large developing regions to emit less than their moral claim will put the Paris Agreement at risk.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="jenkins_tonga_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Tonga eruption increases chance of temporary surface temperature anomaly above 1.5 °C</div> <div class="author"> Stuart Jenkins, <em>Chris Smith</em>, Myles Allen, and Roy Grainger </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nature Climate Change</em>, Feb 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01568-2" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01568-2" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="141158887"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1038/s41558-022-01568-2" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>On 15 January 2022, the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai (HTHH) eruption injected 146 MtH2O and 0.42 MtSO2 into the stratosphere.

These drivers include non-CO2 greenhouse gases, short-lived climate forcers such as aerosol and ozone precursors, and changes in the land surface. Smart targeting of these non-CO2 drivers, in combination with a serious and sustained attempt to reach net-zero CO2 emissions, could result in substantial avoided climate damages. Evaluating the climate effect of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is not yet possible in most state-of-the-art climate models, though exciting developments are occurring. Simpler tools including reduced-complexity climate models and climate metrics are currently used to evaluate the climate impacts of non-CO2 drivers.

A key task in WGIII is to assess the global mean temperature outcomes of these scenarios in a consistent manner, given the challenge that the emissions scenarios from different integrated assessment models (IAMs) come with different sectoral and gas-to-gas coverage and cannot all be assessed consistently by complex Earth system models. In this work, we describe the “climate-assessment” workflow and its methods, including infilling of missing emissions and emissions harmonisation as applied to 1202 mitigation scenarios in AR6 WGIII. We evaluate the global mean temperature projections and effective radiative forcing (ERF) characteristics of climate emulators FaIRv1.6.2 and MAGICCv7.5.3 and use the CICERO simple climate model (CICERO-SCM) for sensitivity analysis. We discuss the implied overshoot severity of the mitigation pathways using overshoot degree years and look at emissions and temperature characteristics of scenarios compatible with one possible interpretation of the Paris Agreement. We find that the lowest class of emissions scenarios that limit global warming to “1.5 ∘C (with a probability of greater than 50 %) with no or limited overshoot” includes 97 scenarios for MAGICCv7.5.3 and 203 for FaIRv1.6.2. For the MAGICCv7.5.3 results, “limited overshoot” typically implies exceedance of median temperature projections of up to about 0.1 ∘C for up to a few decades before returning to below 1.5 ∘C by or before the year 2100. For more than half of the scenarios in this category that comply with three criteria for being “Paris-compatible”, including net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, median temperatures decline by about 0.3–0.4 ∘C after peaking at 1.5–1.6 ∘C in 2035–2055. We compare the methods applied in AR6 with the methods used for SR1.5 and discuss their implications. This article also introduces a “climate-assessment” Python package which allows for fully reproducing the IPCC AR6 WGIII temperature assessment. This work provides a community tool for assessing the temperature outcomes of emissions pathways and provides a basis for further work such as extending the workflow to include downscaling of climate characteristics to a regional level and calculating impacts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="watson-parris_large_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Large uncertainty in future warming due to aerosol forcing</div> <div class="author"> Duncan Watson-Parris, and <em>Christopher J.

Updates to this assessment, such as between the IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) of warming and the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), are the result of intertwined, sometimes opaque, factors. Here we isolate one factor: the Earth System Model emulators used to estimate the global warming implications of scenarios. We show that warming projections using AR6‐calibrated emulators are consistent, to within around 0.1°C, with projections made by the emulators used in SR1.5. The consistency is due to two almost compensating changes: the increase in assessed historical warming between SR1.5 (based on AR5) and AR6, and a reduction in projected warming due to improved agreement between the emulators’ response to emissions and the assessment to which it is calibrated. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="quaas_robust_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Robust evidence for reversal of the trend in aerosol effective climate forcing</div> <div class="author"> Johannes Quaas, Hailing Jia, <em>Chris Smith</em>, Anna Lea Albright, Wenche Aas, Nicolas Bellouin, Olivier Boucher, Marie Doutriaux-Boucher, Piers M.

Due to their short tropospheric lifetime of only several days, the aerosol forcing responds quickly to emissions. Here, we present and discuss the evolution of the aerosol forcing since 2000. There are multiple lines of evidence that allow us to robustly conclude that the anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) – both aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) – has become less negative globally, i.e. the trend in aerosol effective radiative forcing changed sign from negative to positive. Bottom-up inventories show that anthropogenic primary aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions declined in most regions of the world; observations related to aerosol burden show declining trends, in particular of the fine-mode particles that make up most of the anthropogenic aerosols; satellite retrievals of cloud droplet numbers show trends in regions with aerosol declines that are consistent with these in sign, as do observations of top-of-atmosphere radiation. Climate model results, including a revised set that is constrained by observations of the ocean heat content evolution show a consistent sign and magnitude for a positive forcing relative to the year 2000 due to reduced aerosol effects. This reduction leads to an acceleration of the forcing of climate change, i.e. an increase in forcing by 0.1 to 0.3 W m−2, up to 12 % of the total climate forcing in 2019 compared to 1750 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="doi:10.1073/pnas.2206131119" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The key role of propane in a sustainable cooling sector</div> <div class="author"> Pallav Purohit, Lena Höglund-Isaksson, Nathan Borgford-Parnell, Zbigniew Klimont, and Christopher J Smith </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Sep 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2206131119" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2206131119" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="134112203"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1073/pnas.2206131119" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Split air conditioners (ACs) are the most used appliance for space cooling worldwide. The phase-down of refrigerants with high global warming potential (GWP) prescribed by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has triggered a major effort to find less harmful alternative refrigerants. HFC-32 is currently the most common refrigerant to replace HFC-410A in split ACs. The GWP of HFC-32 is about one-third that of HFC-410A but still considerably higher than that of a growing number of nonfluorinated alternatives like propane with a GWP of &lt;1, which have recently become commercially available for split ACs. Here, we show that a switch to propane as an energy-efficient and commercially available low-GWP alternative in split ACs could avoid 0.09 (0.06 to 0.12) °C increase in global temperature by the end of the century. This is significantly more than the 0.03 (0.02 to 0.05) °C avoided warming from a complete switch to HFC-32 in split ACs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="brecha_institutional_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Institutional decarbonization scenarios evaluated against the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C goal</div> <div class="author"> Robert J.

We find that emulation errors can be large (\textgreater0.5°C for SSP2‐4.5) and differ markedly between climate models, forcing scenarios and time periods. Errors arise in emulating the near‐surface temperature response to both greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing; in some periods the errors due to these forcings oppose one another, giving the spurious impression of better emulator performance. Climate feedbacks are assumed constant in the emulator, introducing time‐varying or state dependent feedbacks may reduce prediction errors. Close emulations can be produced for a given period but, crucially, this does not guarantee reliable emulations of other scenarios and periods.

This implies a geophysical commitment to temporarily crossing warming levels before reaching them. Here we use an emissions-based climate model (FaIR) to estimate temperature change following cessation of emissions in 2021 and in every year thereafter until 2080 following eight Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Assuming a medium-emissions trajectory (SSP2–4.5), we find that we are already committed to peak warming greater than 1.5 °C with 42% probability, increasing to 66% by 2029 (340 GtCO2 relative to 2021). Probability of peak warming greater than 2.0 °C is currently 2%, increasing to 66% by 2057 (1,550 GtCO2 relative to 2021). Because climate will cool from peak warming as GHG concentrations decline, committed warming of 1.5 °C in 2100 will not occur with at least 66% probability until 2055.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="fewster_imminent_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Imminent loss of climate space for permafrost peatlands in Europe and Western Siberia</div> <div class="author"> Richard E.

However, the spatio-temporal dynamics of permafrost peatland thaw remain uncertain due to complex permafrost–climate interactions, the insulating properties of peat soils and variation in model projections of future climate. Here we show that permafrost peatlands in Europe and Western Siberia will soon surpass a climatic tipping point under scenarios of moderate-to-high warming (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). The total peatland area affected under these scenarios contains 37.0–39.5 Gt carbon (equivalent to twice the amount of carbon stored in European forests). Our bioclimatic models indicate that all of Fennoscandia will become climatically unsuitable for peatland permafrost by 2040. Strong action to reduce emissions (SSP1-2.6) by the 2090s could retain suitable climates for permafrost peatlands storing 13.9 Gt carbon in northernmost Western Siberia, indicating that socio-economic policies will determine the rate and extent of permafrost peatland thaw.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="myhre_scientific_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Scientific data from precipitation driver response model intercomparison project</div> <div class="author"> Gunnar Myhre, Bjørn Samset, Piers M.

The purpose of the GCM simulations has been to enhance the scientific understanding of how changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, and incoming solar radiation perturb the Earth’s radiation balance and its climate response in terms of changes in temperature and precipitation. Here we provide global and annual mean results for a large set of coupled atmospheric-ocean GCM simulations and a description of how to easily extract files from the dataset. The simulations consist of single idealized perturbations to the climate system and have been shown to achieve important insight in complex climate simulations.

Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, ensuring that these changes will be felt for centuries beyond 2100, the current benchmark for projection. Estimating the effects of past, current, and potential future emissions to only 2100 is therefore short‐sighted. Critical problems for food production and climate‐forced human migration are projected to arise well before 2100, raising questions regarding the habitability of some regions of the Earth after the turn of the century. To highlight the need for more distant horizon scanning, we model climate change to 2500 under a suite of emission scenarios and quantify associated projections of crop viability and heat stress. Together, our projections show global climate impacts increase significantly after 2100 without rapid mitigation. As a result, we argue that projections of climate and its effects on human well‐being and associated governance and policy must be framed beyond 2100.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="scott_demand_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Demand vs supply-side approaches to mitigation: What final energy demand assumptions are made to meet 1.5 and 2 °C targets?</div> <div class="author"> Kate Scott, <em>Christopher J.

Consumption is the main driver behind recent increases in global greenhouse gas emissions, outpacing savings through improved technologies, and therefore its representation in the evidence base will impact on the success of policy interventions. The IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR1.5) summarises global evidence on pathways for meeting below-2 °C targets, underpinned by a suite of scenarios from integrated assessment models (IAMs). We explore how final energy demand is framed within these, with the aim to making demand-related assumptions more transparent, and evaluating their significance, feasibility, and use or underutilisation as a mitigation lever. We investigate how the integrated assessment models compensate for higher and lower levels of final energy demand across scenarios, and how this varies when mitigating for 2 °C and 1.5 °C temperature targets through an analysis of (1) final energy demand projections, (2) energy-economy relationships and (3) differences between energy system decarbonisation and carbon dioxide removal in the highest and lowest energy demand pathways. We look across the full suite of mitigation pathways and assess the consequences of achieving different global carbon budgets. We find that energy demand in 2100 in the highest energy demand scenarios is approximately three to four times higher than the lowest demand pathways, but we do not find strong evidence that 1.5 °C-consistent pathways cluster on the lower end of demand levels, particularly when they allow for overshoot. The majority of demand reductions happen pre-2040, which assumes absolute decoupling from economic growth in the near-term; thereafter final energy demand levels generally grow to 2100. Lower energy demand pathways moderately result in lower renewable energy supply and lower energy system investment, but do not necessarily reduce reliance on carbon dioxide removal. In this sense, there is more scope for IAMs to implement energy demand reduction as a longer-term mitigation lever and to reduce reliance on negative emissions technologies. We demonstrate the need for integrated assessments to play closer attention to how final energy demand interacts with, relates to, and can potentially offset supply-side characteristics, alongside a more diverse evidence base. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="dong_biased_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Biased Estimates of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity and Transient Climate Response Derived From Historical CMIP6 Simulations</div> <div class="author"> Yue Dong, Kyle C.

These calculations are enabled by use of the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) simulations, which permit accurate quantification of the radiative forcing. Long‐term historical energy budget constraints generally underestimate EffCS from CO 2 quadrupling and TCR from CO 2 ramping, owing to changes in radiative feedbacks and changes in ocean heat uptake efficiency. Atmospheric GCMs forced by observed warming patterns produce lower values of EffCS that are more in line with those inferred from observed historical energy budget changes. The differences in the EffCS estimates from historical energy budget constraints of models and observations are traced to discrepancies between modeled and observed historical surface warming patterns. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="trascasa-castro_what_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">What Can We Do to Address Climate Change?</div> <div class="author"> Paloma Trascasa-Castro, and <em>Christopher J.

Climate simulations show that Earth will only stop warming when we reach “net zero” emissions. This means that carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions are cancelled out by an equal amount of greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere. Worldwide efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 are necessary to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. Achieving net zero will require huge changes to our society. While there are some things we can all do to fight climate change, the biggest changes need to come from the way our businesses and countries are run, where we get our energy from, how we travel, and how much “stuff” we consume and waste.

In contrast, the previous generation of models (CMIP5) performed well over this period. It has been hypothesized that this suppressed late-20th Century warming seen in CMIP6 is caused by a stronger aerosol forcing. However, we find this to be only part of the story. Not only is the aerosol forcing marginally more negative in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5, the greenhouse gas forcing in CMIP6 is also weaker than in CMIP5. These forcing differences are amplified by differences in climate sensitivity between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensemble, which leads to both a stronger aerosol cooling over 1960–1990 and a stronger greenhouse gas induced warming from 1990, returning the warming post-2000 toward the observed level.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="huppmann_pyam_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">pyam: Analysis and visualisation of integrated assessment and macro-energy scenarios</div> <div class="author"> Daniel Huppmann, Matthew J.

The package aims to facilitate reproducibility and reliability of scenario processing, validation and analysis by providing well-tested and documented methods for working with timeseries data in the context of climate policy and energy systems. It supports various data formats, including sub-annual resolution using continuous time representation and "representative timeslices". The pyam package can be useful for modelers generating scenario results using their own tools as well as researchers and analysts working with existing scenario ensembles such as those supporting the IPCC reports or produced in research projects. It is structured in a way that it can be applied irrespective of a user’s domain expertise or level of Python knowledge, supporting experts as well as novice users.

We find that the time history of aerosol ERFs diagnosed in CMIP6 models exhibits considerable variation and explore how the time history of aerosol forcing influences the probability distributions of present-day aerosol forcing and emergent metrics such as climate sensitivity. Using a simple energy balance model, trained on CMIP6 climate models and constrained by observed near-surface warming and ocean heat uptake, we derive estimates for the historical aerosol forcing. We find 2005–2014 mean aerosol ERF to be −1.1 (−1.8 to −0.5) W m−2 relative to 1750. Assuming recently published historical emissions from fossil fuel and industrial sectors and biomass burning emissions from SSP2-4.5, aerosol ERF in 2019 is −0.9 (−1.5 to −0.4) W m−2. There is a modest recovery in aerosol forcing (+0.025 W m−2 decade−1) between 1980 and 2014. This analysis also gives a 5%–95% range of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.8°C –5.1°C (best estimate 3.1°C) with a transient climate response of 1.2°C –2.6°C (best estimate 1.8°C).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="nicholls_reduced_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2: Synthesizing Earth System Knowledge for Probabilistic Climate Projections</div> <div class="author"> Z.

Our best tools to capture state‐of‐the‐art knowledge in an internally self‐consistent modeling framework are the increasingly complex fully coupled Earth System Models (ESMs). However, computational limitations and the structural rigidity of ESMs mean that the full range of uncertainties across multiple domains are difficult to capture with ESMs alone. The tools of choice are instead more computationally efficient reduced complexity models (RCMs), which are structurally flexible and can span the response dynamics across a range of domain‐specific models and ESM experiments. Here we present Phase 2 of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP Phase 2), the first comprehensive intercomparison of RCMs that are probabilistically calibrated with key benchmark ranges from specialized research communities. Unsurprisingly, but crucially, we find that models which have been constrained to reflect the key benchmarks better reflect the key benchmarks. Under the low‐emissions SSP1‐1.9 scenario, across the RCMs, median peak warming projections range from 1.3 to 1.7°C (relative to 1850–1900, using an observationally based historical warming estimate of 0.8°C between 1850–1900 and 1995–2014). Further developing methodologies to constrain these projection uncertainties seems paramount given the international community’s goal to contain warming to below 1.5°C above preindustrial in the long‐term. Our findings suggest that users of RCMs should carefully evaluate their RCM, specifically its skill against key benchmarks and consider the need to include projections benchmarks either from ESM results or other assessments to reduce divergence in future projections. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="leach_fair_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">FaIRv2.0.0: A generalized impulse response model for climate uncertainty and future scenario exploration</div> <div class="author"> Nicholas J.

In this update we have focussed on identifying a minimum level of structural complexity in the model. The result is a set of six equations, five of which correspond to the standard impulse response model used for greenhouse gas (GHG) metric calculations in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, plus one additional physically motivated equation to represent state-dependent feedbacks on the response timescales of each greenhouse gas cycle. This additional equation is necessary to reproduce non-linearities in the carbon cycle apparent in both Earth system models and observations. These six equations are transparent and sufficiently simple that the model is able to be ported into standard tabular data analysis packages, such as Excel, increasing the potential user base considerably. However, we demonstrate that the equations are flexible enough to be tuned to emulate the behaviour of several key processes within more complex models from CMIP6. The model is exceptionally quick to run, making it ideal for integrating large probabilistic ensembles. We apply a constraint based on the current estimates of the global warming trend to a million-member ensemble, using the constrained ensemble to make scenario-dependent projections and infer ranges for properties of the climate system. Through these analyses, we reaffirm that simple climate models (unlike more complex models) are not themselves intrinsically biased "hot"or "cold": it is the choice of parameters and how those are selected that determines the model response, something that appears to have been misunderstood in the past. This updated FaIR model is able to reproduce the global climate system response to GHG and aerosol emissions with sufficient accuracy to be useful in a wide range of applications and therefore could be used as a lowest-common-denominator model to provide consistency in different contexts. The fact that FaIR can be written down in just six equations greatly aids transparency in such contexts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="edwards_projected_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Projected land ice contributions to twenty-first-century sea level rise</div> <div class="author"> Tamsin L.

Two recent international projects generated a large suite of projections using multiple models, but primarily used previous-generation scenarios and climate models10, and could not fully explore known uncertainties. Here we estimate probability distributions for these projections under the new scenarios using statistical emulation of the ice sheet and glacier models. We find that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would halve the land ice contribution to twenty-first-century sea level rise, relative to current emissions pledges. The median decreases from 25 to 13 centimetres sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level contribution. The projected Antarctic contribution does not show a clear response to the emissions scenario, owing to uncertainties in the competing processes of increasing ice loss and snowfall accumulation in a warming climate. However, under risk-averse (pessimistic) assumptions, Antarctic ice loss could be five times higher, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 centimetres SLE under current policies and pledges, with the 95th percentile projection exceeding half a metre even under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. This would severely limit the possibility of mitigating future coastal flooding. Given this large range (between 13 centimetres SLE using the main projections under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 42 centimetres SLE using risk-averse projections under current pledges), adaptation planning for twenty-first-century sea level rise must account for a factor-of-three uncertainty in the land ice contribution until climate policies and the Antarctic response are further constrained. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="kramer_observational_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Observational Evidence of Increasing Global Radiative Forcing</div> <div class="author"> Ryan J.

This fundamental metric has not been directly observed globally and previous estimates have come from models. In part, this is because current space‐based instruments cannot distinguish the instantaneous radiative forcing from the climate’s radiative response. We apply radiative kernels to satellite observations to disentangle these components and find all‐sky instantaneous radiative forcing has increased 0.53 ± 0.11 W/m 2 from 2003 to 2018, accounting for positive trends in the total planetary radiative imbalance. This increase has been due to a combination of rising concentrations of well‐mixed greenhouse gases and recent reductions in aerosol emissions. These results highlight distinct fingerprints of anthropogenic activity in Earth’s changing energy budget, which we find observations can detect within 4 years. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="maycock_structure_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On the Structure of Instantaneous Radiative Forcing Kernels for Greenhouse Gases</div> <div class="author"> Amanda C.

All gases produce IRFKs that peak in the tropical upper troposphere. In addition to differences in spectroscopic intensities and the position of absorption features relative to the peak of the Planck function for Earth’s temperature, the variation in current background concentration of gases substantially affects the IRFK magnitudes. When the background concentration of CO 2 is reduced from parts per million to parts per trillion levels, the peak magnitude of the IRFK increases by a factor of 642. When all gases are set to parts per trillion concentrations in the troposphere, the peak IRFK magnitudes are 1.0, 3.0, 3.1, 58, and 75 W m −2 ppmv −1 (100 hPa) −1 for CH 4 , CO 2 , N 2 O, O 3 , and CFC-11, respectively. The altitude of the IRFK maximum also differs, with the maximum for CFC-11 and water vapor occurring above 100 hPa whereas the other gases peak near 150–200 hPa. Overlap with water vapor absorption decreases the magnitude of the IRFKs for all of the GHGs, particularly in the lower-to-middle troposphere, but it does not strongly affect the peak IRFK altitude. Cloud radiative effects reduce the magnitude of the IRFK for CO 2 by around 10%–20% in the upper troposphere. The use of IRFKs to estimate instantaneous radiative forcing is found to be accurate for small-amplitude perturbations but becomes inaccurate for large-amplitude changes (e.g., a doubling) for gases with a higher atmospheric optical depth.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="dow_effect_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Effect of Anthropogenic Aerosols on the Aleutian Low</div> <div class="author"> William J.

However, the robustness of this connection is debated. This study analyzes changes to the Aleutian low in an ensemble of climate models forced with large, idealized global and regional black carbon (BC) and sulfate aerosol perturbations. To isolate the role of ocean feedbacks, the experiments are performed with an interactive ocean and with prescribed sea surface temperatures. The results show a robust weakening of the Aleutian low forced by a global tenfold increase in BC in both experiment configurations. A linearized steady-state primitive equation model is forced with diabatic heating anomalies to investigate the mechanisms through which heating from BC emissions influences the Aleutian low. The heating from BC absorption over India and East Asia generates Rossby wave trains that propagate into the North Pacific sector, forming an upper-tropospheric ridge. Sources of BC outside of East Asia enhance the weakening of the Aleutian low. The responses to a global fivefold and regional tenfold increase in sulfate aerosols over Asia show poor consistency across climate models, with a multimodel mean response that does not project strongly onto the Aleutian low. These findings for a large, idealized step increase in regional sulfate aerosol differ from previous studies that suggest the transient increase in sulfate aerosols over Asia during the early twenty-first century weakened the Aleutian low and induced a transition to a negative PDO phase.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="andrews_effective_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effective Radiative Forcing in a GCM With Fixed Surface Temperatures</div> <div class="author"> Timothy Andrews, <em>Christopher J.

The 4xCO 2 ERF is 8.0 W m −2 . In contrast, a typical ERF experiment with only fixed SST and sea‐ice gives rise to an ERF of only 7.0 W m −2 . This difference arises due to the influence of land warming in the commonly used fixed‐SST ERF experimental design, which results in: (i) increased emission of longwave radiation to space from the land surface (−0.45 W m −2 ) and troposphere (−0.90 W m −2 ), (ii) reduced land snow‐cover and albedo (+0.17 W m −2 ), (iii) increased water‐vapor (+0.49 W m −2 ), and (iv) a cloud adjustment (−0.26 W m −2 ) due to reduced stability and cloudiness over land (positive ERF) counteracted by increased lower tropospheric stability and marine cloudiness over oceans (negative ERF). The sum of these radiative adjustments to land warming is to reduce the 4xCO 2 ERF in fixed‐SST experiments by ∼1.0 W m −2 . CO 2 stomatal effects are quantified and found to contribute just over half of the land warming effect and adjustments in the fixed‐SST ERF experimental design in this model. The basic physical mechanisms in response to land warming are confirmed in a solar ERF experiment. We test various methods that have been proposed to account for land warming in fixed‐SST ERFs against our GCM results and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mckenna_stringent_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Stringent mitigation substantially reduces risk of unprecedented near-term warming rates</div> <div class="author"> Christine M.

Stringent mitigation will have clear societal benefits in the second half of this century by limiting peak warming and stabilizing climate. However, the near-term benefits of mitigation are generally thought to be less clear because forced surface temperature trends can be masked by internal variability. Here we use observationally constrained projections from the latest comprehensive climate models and a simple climate model emulator to show that pursuing stringent mitigation consistent with holding long-term warming below 1.5 °C reduces the risk of unprecedented warming rates in the next 20 years by a factor of 13 compared with a no mitigation scenario, even after accounting for internal variability. Therefore, in addition to long-term benefits, stringent mitigation offers substantial near-term benefits by offering societies and ecosystems a greater chance to adapt to and avoid the worst climate change impacts. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="damon_matthews_integrated_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An integrated approach to quantifying uncertainties in the remaining carbon budget</div> <div class="author"> H Damon Matthews, Katarzyna B Tokarska, Joeri Rogelj, Christopher J Smith, Andrew H MacDougall, Karsten Haustein, Nadine Mengis, Sebastian Sippel, Piers M Forster, and Reto Knutti </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>, Feb 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00064-9" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00064-9" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="97907514"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1038/s43247-020-00064-9" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The remaining carbon budget quantifies the future CO2 emissions to limit global warming below a desired level.

Concentration and emission changes of reactive species can cause multiple changes in the composition of radiatively active species: tropospheric ozone, stratospheric ozone, stratospheric water vapour, secondary inorganic and organic aerosol, and methane. Where possible we break down the ERFs from each emitted species into the contributions from the composition changes. The ERFs are calculated for each of the models that participated in the AerChemMIP experiments as part of the CMIP6 project, where the relevant model output was available. The 1850 to 2014 multi-model mean ERFs (± standard deviations) are -1.03 ± 0.37 W m-2 for SO2 emissions, -0.25 ± 0.09 W m-2 for organic carbon (OC), 0.15 ± 0.17 W m-2 for black carbon (BC) and -0.07 ± 0.01 W m-2 for NH3. For the combined aerosols (in the piClim-aer experiment) it is -1.01 ± 0.25 W m-2. The multi-model means for the reactive well-mixed greenhouse gases (including any effects on ozone and aerosol chemistry) are 0.67 ± 0.17 W m-2 for methane (CH4), 0.26 ± 0.07 W m-2 for nitrous oxide (N2O) and 0.12 ± 0.2 W m-2 for ozone-depleting halocarbons (HC). Emissions of the ozone precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds and both together (O3) lead to ERFs of 0.14 ± 0.13, 0.09 ± 0.14 and 0.20 ± 0.07 W m-2 respectively. The differences in ERFs calculated for the different models reflect differences in the complexity of their aerosol and chemistry schemes, especially in the case of methane where tropospheric chemistry captures increased forcing from ozone production. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="thornhill_climate-driven_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Climate-driven chemistry and aerosol feedbacks in CMIP6 Earth system models</div> <div class="author"> Gillian D.

The latest generation of Earth system models includes aerosol and chemistry components that interact with each other and with the biosphere. These interactions introduce a complex web of feedbacks that is important to understand and quantify. This paper addresses multiple pathways for aerosol and chemical feedbacks in Earth system models. These focus on changes in natural emissions (dust, sea salt, dimethyl sulfide, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and lightning) and changes in reaction rates for methane and ozone chemistry. The feedback terms are then given by the sensitivity of a pathway to climate change multiplied by the radiative effect of the change. We find that the overall climate feedback through chemistry and aerosols is negative in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) Earth system models due to increased negative forcing from aerosols in a climate with warmer surface temperatures following a quadrupling of CO2 concentrations. This is principally due to increased emissions of sea salt and BVOCs which are sensitive to climate change and cause strong negative radiative forcings. Increased chemical loss of ozone and methane also contributes to a negative feedback. However, overall methane lifetime is expected to increase in a warmer climate due to increased BVOCs. Increased emissions of methane from wetlands would also offset some of the negative feedbacks. The CMIP6 experimental design did not allow the methane lifetime or methane emission changes to affect climate, so we found a robust negative contribution from interactive aerosols and chemistry to climate sensitivity in CMIP6 Earth system models. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hodnebrog_effect_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The effect of rapid adjustments to halocarbons and N2O on radiative forcing</div> <div class="author"> Øivind Hodnebrog, Gunnar Myhre, Ryan J.

Knowledge of such adjustments is necessary to estimate effective radiative forcing (ERF), a useful indicator of surface temperature change, and to understand global precipitation changes due to different drivers. Yet, rapid adjustments have not previously been analysed in any detail for certain compounds, including halocarbons and N 2 O. Here we use several global climate models combined with radiative kernel calculations to show that individual rapid adjustment terms due to CFC-11, CFC-12 and N 2 O are substantial, but that the resulting flux changes approximately cancel at the top-of-atmosphere due to compensating effects. Our results further indicate that radiative forcing (which includes stratospheric temperature adjustment) is a reasonable approximation for ERF. These CFCs lead to a larger increase in precipitation per kelvin surface temperature change (2.2 ± 0.3% K −1 ) compared to other well-mixed greenhouse gases (1.4 ± 0.3% K −1 for CO 2 ). This is largely due to rapid upper tropospheric warming and cloud adjustments, which lead to enhanced atmospheric radiative cooling (and hence a precipitation increase) and partly compensate increased atmospheric radiative heating (i.e. which is associated with a precipitation decrease) from the instantaneous perturbation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="nicholls_reduced_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project Phase 1: introduction and evaluation of global-mean temperature response</div> <div class="author"> Zebedee R.

To date, evaluation of RCMs has been limited to a few independent studies. Here we introduce a systematic evaluation of RCMs in the form of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP). We expect RCMIP will extend over multiple phases, with Phase 1 being the first. In Phase 1, we focus on the RCMs’ global-mean temperature responses, comparing them to observations, exploring the extent to which they emulate more complex models and considering how the relationship between temperature and cumulative emissions of CO2 varies across the RCMs. Our work uses experiments which mirror those found in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which focuses on complex Earth system and atmosphere–ocean general circulation models. Using both scenario-based and idealised experiments, we examine RCMs’ global-mean temperature response under a range of forcings. We find that the RCMs can all reproduce the approximately 1 ∘C of warming since pre-industrial times, with varying representations of natural variability, volcanic eruptions and aerosols. We also find that RCMs can emulate the global-mean temperature response of CMIP models to within a root-mean-square error of 0.2 ∘C over a range of experiments. Furthermore, we find that, for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)-based scenario pairs that share the same IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)-consistent stratospheric-adjusted radiative forcing, the RCMs indicate higher effective radiative forcings for the SSP-based scenarios and correspondingly higher temperatures when run with the same climate settings. In our idealised setup of RCMs with a climate sensitivity of 3 ∘C, the difference for the ssp585–rcp85 pair by 2100 is around 0.23∘C(±0.12 ∘C) due to a difference in effective radiative forcings between the two scenarios. Phase 1 demonstrates the utility of RCMIP’s open-source infrastructure, paving the way for further phases of RCMIP to build on the research presented here and deepen our understanding of RCMs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="forster_current_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Current and future global climate impacts resulting from COVID-19</div> <div class="author"> Piers M.

Here, using national mobility data, we estimate global emission reductions for ten species during the period February to June 2020. We estimate that global NOx emissions declined by as much as 30% in April, contributing a short-term cooling since the start of the year. This cooling trend is offset by  20% reduction in global SO2 emissions that weakens the aerosol cooling effect, causing short-term warming. As a result, we estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01 ± 0.005 °C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3 °C by 2050. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="marshall_large_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Large Variations in Volcanic Aerosol Forcing Efficiency Due to Eruption Source Parameters and Rapid Adjustments</div> <div class="author"> Lauren R.

In their Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used one scaling factor between volcanic SAOD and volcanic forcing based on climate model simulations of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption, which may not be appropriate for all eruptions. Using a large ensemble of aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of eruptions with different sulfur dioxide emissions, latitudes, emission altitudes, and seasons, we find that the effective radiative forcing (ERF) is on average 20% less than the instantaneous radiative forcing, predominantly due to a positive shortwave cloud adjustment. In our model, the volcanic SAOD-ERF relationship is non-unique and varies widely depending on time since an eruption, eruption latitude, and season due to differences in aerosol dispersion and incoming solar radiation. Our revised SAOD-ERF relationships suggest that volcanic forcing has been previously overestimated.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_hadgem3-ga71_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The HadGEM3-GA7.1 radiative kernel: the importance of a well-resolved stratosphere</div> <div class="author"> <em>Christopher J.

We show that the utility of radiative kernels for forcing adjustments in idealised CO2 perturbation experiments is greatest where there is sufficiently high resolution in the stratosphere in both the target climate model and the radiative kernel. This is because stratospheric cooling to a CO2 perturbation continues to increase with height, and low-resolution or low-top kernels or climate model output are unable to fully resolve the full stratospheric temperature adjustment. In the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), standard atmospheric model data are available up to 1 hPa on 19 pressure levels, which is a substantial advantage compared to CMIP5. We show in the IPSL-CM6A-LR model where a full set of climate diagnostics are available that the HadGEM3-GA7.1 kernel exhibits linear behaviour and the residual error term is small, as well as from a survey of kernels available in the literature that in general low-top radiative kernels underestimate the stratospheric temperature response.

We evaluate effective radiative forcing and adjustments in 17 contemporary climate models that are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and have contributed to the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP). Present-day (2014) global-mean anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial (1850) levels from climate models stands at 2.00 (±0.23) W m−2, comprised of 1.81 (±0.09) W m−2 from CO2, 1.08 (± 0.21) W m−2 from other well-mixed greenhouse gases, −1.01 (± 0.23) W m−2 from aerosols and −0.09 (±0.13) W m−2 from land use change. Quoted uncertainties are 1 standard deviation across model best estimates, and 90 % confidence in the reported forcings, due to internal variability, is typically within 0.1 W m−2. The majority of the remaining 0.21 W m−2 is likely to be from ozone. In most cases, the largest contributors to the spread in effective radiative forcing (ERF) is from the instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) and from cloud responses, particularly aerosol–cloud interactions to aerosol forcing. As determined in previous studies, cancellation of tropospheric and surface adjustments means that the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing is approximately equal to ERF for greenhouse gas forcing but not for aerosols, and consequentially, not for the anthropogenic total. The spread of aerosol forcing ranges from −0.63 to −1.37 W m−2, exhibiting a less negative mean and narrower range compared to 10 CMIP5 models. The spread in 4×CO2 forcing has also narrowed in CMIP6 compared to 13 CMIP5 models. Aerosol forcing is uncorrelated with climate sensitivity. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the increasing spread in climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models, particularly related to high-sensitivity models, is a consequence of a stronger negative present-day aerosol forcing and little evidence that modelling groups are systematically tuning climate sensitivity or aerosol forcing to recreate observed historical warming.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="dittus_sensitivity_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Sensitivity of Historical Climate Simulations to Uncertain Aerosol Forcing</div> <div class="author"> Andrea J.

We analyze a novel large ensemble of simulations with HadGEM3‐GC3.1 for 1850–2014, where anthropogenic aerosol and precursor emissions are scaled to sample a wide range of historical aerosol radiative forcing with present‐day values ranging from –0.38 to –1.50 Wm –2 . Five ensemble members are run for each of five aerosol scaling factors. Decadal variations in surface temperatures are strongly sensitive to aerosol forcing, particularly between 1950 and 1980. Post‐1980, trends are dominated by greenhouse gas forcing, with much lower sensitivity to aerosol emission differences. Most realizations with aerosol forcing more negative than about –1 Wm –2 simulate stronger cooling trends in the mid‐20th century compared with observations, while the simulated warming post‐1980 always exceeds observed warming, likelydue to a warm bias in the transient climate response in HadGEM3‐GC3.1. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="essd-12-1649-2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Radiative forcing of climate change from the Copernicus reanalysis of atmospheric composition</div> <div class="author"> Nicolas Bellouin, Will Davies, Keith P Shine, Johannes Quaas, Johannes Mülmenstädt, Piers M Forster, <em>Chris Smith</em>, Lindsay Lee, Leighton Regayre, Guy Brasseur, Natalia Sudarchikova, Idir Bouarar, Olivier Boucher, and Gunnar Myhre </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Earth System Science Data</em>, Jul 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-1649-2020" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1649/2020/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="88411741"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.5194/essd-12-1649-2020" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Radiative forcing provides an important basis for understanding and predicting global climate changes, but its quantification has historically been done independently for different forcing agents, has involved observations to varying degrees, and studies have not always included a detailed analysis of uncertainties. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis is an optimal combination of modelling and observations of atmospheric composition. It provides a unique opportunity to rely on observations to quantify the monthly and spatially resolved global distributions of radiative forcing consistently for six of the largest forcing agents: carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, stratospheric ozone, aerosol-radiation interactions, and aerosol-cloud interactions. These radiative-forcing estimates account for adjustments in stratospheric temperatures but do not account for rapid adjustments in the troposphere. On a global average and over the period 2003-2017, stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing of carbon dioxide has averaged +1.89 W m-2 (5 %-95 % confidence interval: 1.50 to 2.29 W m-2) relative to 1750 and increased at a rate of 18 % per decade. The corresponding values for methane are +0.46 (0.36 to 0.56) W m-2 and 4 % per decade but with a clear acceleration since 2007. Ozone radiative-forcing averages +0.32 (0 to 0.64) W m-2, almost entirely contributed by tropospheric ozone since stratospheric ozone radiative forcing is only +0.003 W m-2. Aerosol radiative-forcing averages -1.25 (-1.98 to -0.52) W m-2, with aerosol-radiation interactions contributing -0.56 W m-2 and aerosol-cloud interactions contributing -0.69 W m-2 to the global average. Both have been relatively stable since 2003. Taking the six forcing agents together, there is no indication of a sustained slowdown or acceleration in the rate of increase in anthropogenic radiative forcing over the period. These ongoing radiative-forcing estimates will monitor the impact on the Earth’s energy budget of the dramatic emission reductions towards net-zero that are needed to limit surface temperature warming to the Paris Agreement temperature targets. Indeed, such impacts should be clearly manifested in radiative forcing before being clear in the temperature record. In addition, this radiative-forcing dataset can provide the input distributions needed by researchers involved in monitoring of climate change, detection and attribution, interannual to decadal prediction, and integrated assessment modelling.

Much of the uncertainty in the direct aerosol forcing can be attributed to uncertainty in the anthropogenic fraction of aerosol in the present‐day atmosphere, due to a lack of historical observations. Here, we present a robust relationship between total present‐day aerosol optical depth and the anthropogenic contribution across three multimodel ensembles and a large single‐model perturbed parameter ensemble. Using observations of aerosol optical depth, we determine a reduced likely range of the anthropogenic component and hence a reduced uncertainty in the direct forcing of aerosol. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Tokarskaeaaz9549" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Past warming trend constrains future warming in CMIP6 models</div> <div class="author"> Katarzyna B Tokarska, Martin B Stolpe, Sebastian Sippel, Erich M Fischer, Christopher J Smith, Flavio Lehner, and Reto Knutti </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Science Advances</em>, Mar 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9549" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/12/eaaz9549" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="77805092"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1126/sciadv.aaz9549" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Future global warming estimates have been similar across past assessments, but several climate models of the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) simulate much stronger warming, apparently inconsistent with past assessments.

Separate lines of evidence suggest that their warming rates may be unrealistically high, but the risk of such eventualities only emphasizes the need for rapid and deep reductions in emissions. So far, one-third of the latest-generation climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) exhibits a higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) than did the previous generation (CMIP5). As a result, several CMIP6 models simulate greater warming over the twenty-first century (https://phys.org/news/2019-09-earth-quickly-climate.html). This might suggest smaller remaining carbon budgets or a need to reach net-zero emissions sooner to limit warming to targets set forth in the Paris Agreement. However, carbon budgets and net-zero emissions dates are also sensitive to other factors, including the transient climate response (TCR) and aerosol effects. Here, we argue that the CMIP6 models showing the highest warming are unlikely to be representative of the real world, and that CMIP6 projections of global surface temperature should not be exclusively relied on for policy-relevant decisions. Nevertheless, the new generation of results still has scientific value and strengthens the case for urgent mitigation. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="richardson_efficacy_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Efficacy of Climate Forcings in PDRMIP Models</div> <div class="author"> T.

This study presents a systematic multimodel analysis of different climate driver efficacies using simulations from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). Efficacies calculated from instantaneous radiative forcing deviate considerably from unity across forcing agents and models. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is a better predictor of global mean near‐surface air temperature (GSAT) change. Efficacies are closest to one when ERF is computed using fixed sea surface temperature experiments and adjusted for land surface temperature changes using radiative kernels. Multimodel mean efficacies based on ERF are close to one for global perturbations of methane, sulfate, black carbon, and insolation, but there is notable intermodel spread. We do not find robust evidence that the geographic location of sulfate aerosol affects its efficacy. GSAT is found to respond more slowly to aerosol forcing than CO 2 in the early stages of simulations. Despite these differences, we find that there is no evidence for an efficacy effect on historical GSAT trend estimates based on simulations with an impulse response model, nor on the resulting estimates of climate sensitivity derived from the historical period. However, the considerable intermodel spread in the computed efficacies means that we cannot rule out an efficacy‐induced bias of ±0.4 K in equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO 2 doubling when estimated using the historical GSAT trend. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Denison_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Guidance on emissions metrics for nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement</div> <div class="author"> Steve Denison, Piers M Forster, and Christopher J Smith </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, Nov 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab4df4" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Fab4df4" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="68724334"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1088/1748-9326/ab4df4" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Many nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement follow the established practice of specifying emissions levels in tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is the emissions metric used most often to aggregate contributions from different greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, the climate impact of pathways expressed in this way is known to be ambiguous. For this reason, alternatives have been proposed but the ambiguity has not been quantified in the context of the Paris Agreement. Here we assess the variation in temperature using pathways consistent with the ambition of limiting temperature increases to well below 2 °C. These are taken from the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15). The CO2 emission levels are adjusted so that the pathways all have the same total CO2 equivalent emissions for a given emissions metric but have different proportions of short-lived and long-lived pollutants. We show that this difference affects projections by up to 0.17 °C when GWP100 is used. Options of reducing this ambiguity include using a different emissions metric or adding supplementary information in NDCs about the emissions levels of individual GHGs. We suggest the latter on the grounds of simplicity and because it does not require agreement on the use of a different emissions metric.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="shindell_climate_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Climate and air-quality benefits of a realistic phase-out of fossil fuels</div> <div class="author"> Drew Shindell, and Christopher J Smith </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nature</em>, Sep 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1554-z" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1554-z" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="66791240"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1038/s41586-019-1554-z" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The combustion of fossil fuels produces emissions of the long-lived greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and of short-lived pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, that contribute to the formation of atmospheric aerosols1. Atmospheric aerosols can cool the climate, masking some of the warming effect that results from the emission of greenhouse gases1. However, aerosol particulates are highly toxic when inhaled, leading to millions of premature deaths per year2,3. The phasing out of unabated fossil-fuel combustion will therefore provide health benefits, but will also reduce the extent to which the warming induced by greenhouse gases is masked by aerosols. Because aerosol levels respond much more rapidly to changes in emissions relative to carbon dioxide, large near-term increases in the magnitude and rate of climate warming are predicted in many idealized studies that typically assume an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic or fossil-fuel-related emissions1,4–9. Here we show that more realistic modelling scenarios do not produce a substantial near-term increase in either the magnitude or the rate of warming, and in fact can lead to a decrease in warming rates within two decades of the start of the fossil-fuel phase-out. Accounting for the time required to transform power generation, industry and transportation leads to gradually increasing and largely offsetting climate impacts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, with the rate of warming further slowed by reductions in fossil-methane emissions. Our results indicate that even the most aggressive plausible transition to a clean-energy society provides benefits for climate change mitigation and air quality at essentially all decadal to centennial timescales.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="rogelj_estimating_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Estimating and tracking the remaining carbon budget for stringent climate targets</div> <div class="author"> Joeri Rogelj, Piers M.

This makes it possible to estimate the remaining carbon budget: the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide that can still be emitted into the atmosphere while holding the global average temperature increase to the limit set by the Paris Agreement. However, a wide range of estimates for the remaining carbon budget has been reported, reducing the effectiveness of the remaining carbon budget as a means of setting emission reduction targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Here we present a framework that enables us to track estimates of the remaining carbon budget and to understand how these estimates can improve over time as scientific knowledge advances. We propose that application of this framework may help to reconcile differences between estimates of the remaining carbon budget and may provide a basis for reducing uncertainty in the range of future estimates. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="stjern_arctic_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Arctic Amplification Response to Individual Climate Drivers</div> <div class="author"> Camilla Weum Stjern, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Bjørn Hallvard Samset, Gunnar Myhre, Piers M.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of short‐lived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, 10 global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO 2 , CH 4 , the solar constant, black carbon, and SO 4 ). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (±0.6) for the SO 4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except black carbon. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO 4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO 2 . </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="allen_observationally_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Observationally constrained aerosol–cloud semi-direct effects</div> <div class="author"> Robert J.

The level of scientific understanding of these rapid cloud adjustments—otherwise known as semi-direct effects (SDEs)—is considered low, with models indicating a likely negative (−0.44 to +0.1 Wm −2 ) forcing. Recent studies suggest this negative SDE is primarily driven by decreases in high-level clouds and enhanced longwave cooling. Here, we investigate the SDE using multiple models driven by observationally constrained fine-mode aerosol forcing without dust and sea salt. Unlike aerosol simulations, which yield a relatively vertically uniform aerosol atmospheric heating profile with significant upper-tropospheric heating, observation-based heating peaks in the lower-troposphere and then decays to zero in the mid-troposphere. We find a significant global annual mean decrease in low- and mid-level clouds, and weaker decreases in high-level clouds, which leads to a positive SDE dominated by shortwave radiation. Thus, in contrast to most studies, we find a robust positive SDE, implying cloud adjustments act to warm the climate system. Sensitivity tests with identical average, but vertically uniform observationally constrained aerosol atmospheric heating result in a negative SDE, due to enhanced longwave cooling as a result of large reductions in high-level clouds. Our results therefore suggest that model simulations lead to a negatively biased SDE, due to an aerosol atmospheric heating profile that is too vertically uniform.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="tang_comparison_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Comparison of Effective Radiative Forcing Calculations Using Multiple Methods, Drivers, and Models</div> <div class="author"> T.

We demonstrate that previously reported apparent consistency between the ERF values derived from fixed sea surface temperature simulations and linear regression holds for most climate forcings, excluding black carbon (BC). When land adjustment is accounted for, however, the fixed sea surface temperature ERF values are generally 10–30% larger than ERFs derived using linear regression across all forcing agents, with a much larger (~70–100%) discrepancy for BC. Except for BC, this difference can be largely reduced by either using radiative kernel techniques or by exponential regression.

It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 °C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 °C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 °C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_understanding_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Understanding Rapid Adjustments to Diverse Forcing Agents</div> <div class="author"> <em>Christopher J.

Different mechanisms are responsible for these adjustments for a variety of climate drivers. These remain to be quantified in detail. It is shown that rapid adjustments reduce the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of black carbon by half of the instantaneous forcing, but for CO2 forcing, rapid adjustments increase ERF. Competing tropospheric adjustments for CO2 forcing are individually significant but sum to zero, such that the ERF equals the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing, but this is not true for other forcing agents. Additional experiments of increase in the solar constant and increase in CH4 are used to show that a key factor of the rapid adjustment for an individual climate driver is changes in temperature in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="myhre_quantifying_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quantifying the Importance of Rapid Adjustments for Global Precipitation Changes</div> <div class="author"> G Myhre, R J Kramer, C J Smith, Ø Hodnebrog, P Forster, B J Soden, B H Samset, C W Stjern, T Andrews, O Boucher, G Faluvegi, D Fläschner, M Kasoar, A Kirkevåg, J.-F.

Here we use radiative kernels to understand the influence of rapid adjustment processes on precipitation in climate models. Rapid adjustments are generally triggered by the initial heating or cooling of the atmosphere from an external climate driver. For precipitation changes, rapid adjustments due to changes in temperature, water vapor, and clouds are most important. In this study we have investigated five climate drivers (CO2, CH4, solar irradiance, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols). The fast precipitation responses to a doubling of CO2 and a 10-fold increase in black carbon are found to be similar, despite very different instantaneous changes in the radiative cooling, individual rapid adjustments, and sensible heating. The model diversity in rapid adjustments is smaller for the experiment involving an increase in the solar irradiance compared to the other climate driver perturbations, and this is also seen in the precipitation changes. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_fair_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">FAIR v1.3: a simple emissions-based impulse response and carbon cycle model</div> <div class="author"> C J Smith, P M Forster, M Allen, N Leach, R J Millar, G A Passerello, and L A Regayre </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Geoscientific Model Development</em>, Jun 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2273-2018" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/11/2273/2018/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="70600224"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.5194/gmd-11-2273-2018" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Simple climate models can be valuable if they are able to replicate aspects of complex fully coupled earth system models. Larger ensembles can be produced, enabling a probabilistic view of future climate change. A simple emissions-based climate model, FAIR, is presented, which calculates atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and effective radiative forcing (ERF) from greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone and other agents. Model runs are constrained to observed temperature change from 1880 to 2016 and produce a range of future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The constrained estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), transient climate response (TCR) and transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) are 2.86 (2.01 to 4.22) K, 1.53 (1.05 to 2.41) K and 1.40 (0.96 to 2.23) K (1000 GtC)−1 (median and 5–95 % credible intervals). These are in good agreement with the likely Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) range, noting that AR5 estimates were derived from a combination of climate models, observations and expert judgement. The ranges of future projections of temperature and ranges of estimates of ECS, TCR and TCRE are somewhat sensitive to the prior distributions of ECS∕TCR parameters but less sensitive to the ERF from a doubling of CO2 or the observational temperature dataset used to constrain the ensemble. Taking these sensitivities into account, there is no evidence to suggest that the median and credible range of observationally constrained TCR or ECS differ from climate model-derived estimates. The range of temperature projections under RCP8.5 for 2081–2100 in the constrained FAIR model ensemble is lower than the emissions-based estimate reported in AR5 by half a degree, owing to differences in forcing assumptions and ECS∕TCR distributions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="samset_climate_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Climate Impacts From a Removal of Anthropogenic Aerosol Emissions</div> <div class="author"> B H Samset, M Sand, C J Smith, S E Bauer, P M Forster, J S Fuglestvedt, S Osprey, and C.-F.

Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with GHG, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of GHG and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing present-day anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate GHG-dominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.5-1.1°C, and precipitation increase of 2.0-4.6%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We find a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under near-term warming, we find that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and GHG forcing. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="stjern_rapid_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Rapid Adjustments Cause Weak Surface Temperature Response to Increased Black Carbon Concentrations</div> <div class="author"> Camilla Weum Stjern, Bjørn Hallvard Samset, Gunnar Myhre, Piers M Forster, Øivind Hodnebrog, Timothy Andrews, Olivier Boucher, Gregory Faluvegi, Trond Iversen, Matthew Kasoar, Viatcheslav Kharin, Alf Kirkevåg, Jean-François Lamarque, Dirk Olivié, Thomas Richardson, Dilshad Shawki, Drew Shindell, Christopher J Smith, Toshihiko Takemura, and Apostolos Voulgarakis </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</em>, Nov 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027326" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027326" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="27297784"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1002/2017JD027326" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> We investigate the climate response to increased concentrations of black carbon (BC), as part of the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). A tenfold increase in BC is simulated by nine global coupled-climate models, producing a model median effective radiative forcing of 0.82 (ranging from 0.41 to 2.91) W m−2, and a warming of 0.67 (0.16 to 1.66) K globally and 1.24 (0.26 to 4.31) K in the Arctic. A strong positive instantaneous radiative forcing (median of 2.10 W m−2 based on five of the models) is countered by negative rapid adjustments (−0.64 W m−2 for the same five models), which dampen the total surface temperature signal. Unlike other drivers of climate change, the response of temperature and cloud profiles to the BC forcing is dominated by rapid adjustments. Low-level cloud amounts increase for all models, while higher-level clouds are diminished. The rapid temperature response is particularly strong above 400 hPa, where increased atmospheric stabilization and reduced cloud cover contrast the response pattern of the other drivers. In conclusion, we find that this substantial increase in BC concentrations does have considerable impacts on important aspects of the climate system. However, some of these effects tend to offset one another, leaving a relatively small median global warming of 0.47 K per W m−2—about 20% lower than the response to a doubling of CO2. Translating the tenfold increase in BC to the present-day impact of anthropogenic BC (given the emissions used in this work) would leave a warming of merely 0.07 K. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_impacts_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Impacts of Stratospheric Sulfate Geoengineering on Global Solar Photovoltaic and Concentrating Solar Power Resource</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J Smith, Julia A.

Stratospheric sulfate injection (SSI) is a geoengineering method proposed to reduce planetary warming by reflecting a proportion of solar radiation back into space that would otherwise warm the surface and lower atmosphere. The authors analyze results from the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model, version 2, Carbon Cycle Stratosphere (HadGEM2-CCS) climate model with stratospheric emissions of 10 Tg yr−1 of SO2, designed to offset global temperature rise by around 1°C. A reduction in concentrating solar power output of 5.9% on average over land is shown under SSI relative to a baseline future climate change scenario (RCP4.5) caused by a decrease in direct radiation. Solar photovoltaic energy is generally less affected as it can use diffuse radiation, which increases under SSI, at the expense of direct radiation. The results from HadGEM2-CCS are compared with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry–Climate Model (GEOSCCM) from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), with 5 Tg yr−1 emission of SO2. In many regions, the differences predicted in solar energy output between the SSI and RCP4.5 simulations are robust, as the sign of the changes for both HadGEM2-CCS and GEOSCCM agree. Furthermore, the sign of the total and direct annual mean radiation changes evaluated by HadGEM2-CCS agrees with the sign of the multimodel mean changes of an ensemble of GeoMIP models over the majority of the world.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_cloud_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cloud cover effect of clear-sky index distributions and differences between human and automatic cloud observations</div> <div class="author"> Christopher J Smith, Jamie M Bright, and Rolf Crook </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Solar Energy</em>, Mar 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.12.055" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85008655987&amp;partnerID=MN8TOARS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="18108380"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1016/j.solener.2016.12.055" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The statistics of clear-sky index can be used to determine solar irradiance when the theoretical clear sky irradiance and the cloud cover are known. In this paper, observations of hourly clear-sky index for the years of 2010–2013 at 63 locations in the UK are analysed for over 1 million data hours. The aggregated distribution of clear-sky index is bimodal, with strong contributions from mostly-cloudy and mostly-clear hours, as well as a lower number of intermediate hours. The clear-sky index exhibits a distribution of values for each cloud cover bin, measured in eighths of the sky covered (oktas), and also depends on solar elevation angle. Cloud cover is measured either by a human observer or automatically with a cloud ceilometer. Irradiation (time-integrated irradiance) values corresponding to human observations of “cloudless” skies (0 oktas) tend to agree better with theoretical clear-sky values, which are calculated with a radiative transfer model, than irradiation values corresponding to automated observations of 0 oktas. It is apparent that the cloud ceilometers incorrectly categorise more non-cloudless hours as cloudless than human observers do. This leads to notable differences in the distributions of clear-sky index for each okta class, and between human and automated observations. Two probability density functions—the Burr (type III) for mostly-clear situations, and generalised gamma for mostly-cloudy situations—are suggested as analytical fits for each cloud coverage, observation type, and solar elevation angle bin. For human observations of overcast skies (8 oktas) where solar elevation angle exceeds 10°, there is no significant difference between the observed clear-sky indices and the generalised gamma distribution fits.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="kovacs_determination_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Determination of the atmospheric lifetime and global warming potential of sulfur hexafluoride using a three-dimensional model</div> <div class="author"> Tamás Kovács, Wuhu Feng, Anna Totterdill, John M C Plane, Sandip Dhomse, Juan Carlos Gómez-Martín, Gabriele P Stiller, Florian J Haenel, Christopher Smith, Piers M Forster, Rolando R García, Daniel R Marsh, and Martyn P Chipperfield </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics</em>, Jan 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-883-2017" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85010036640&amp;partnerID=MN8TOARS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="15605772"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.5194/acp-17-883-2017" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We have used the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), with an updated treatment of loss processes, to determine the atmospheric lifetime of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The model includes the following SF6 removal processes: photolysis, electron attachment and reaction with mesospheric metal atoms. The Sodankylä Ion Chemistry (SIC) model is incorporated into the standard version of WACCM to produce a new version with a detailed D region ion chemistry with cluster ions and negative ions. This is used to determine a latitude- and altitude-dependent scaling factor for the electron density in the standard WACCM in order to carry out multi-year SF6 simulations. The model gives a mean SF6 lifetime over an 11-year solar cycle (τ) of 1278 years (with a range from 1120 to 1475 years), which is much shorter than the currently widely used value of 3200 years, due to the larger contribution (97.4 %) of the modelled electron density to the total atmospheric loss. The loss of SF6 by reaction with mesospheric metal atoms (Na and K) is far too slow to affect the lifetime. We investigate how this shorter atmospheric lifetime impacts the use of SF6 to derive stratospheric age of air. The age of air derived from this shorter lifetime SF6 tracer is longer by 9 % in polar latitudes at 20 km compared to a passive SF6 tracer. We also present laboratory measurements of the infrared spectrum of SF6 and find good agreement with previous studies. We calculate the resulting radiative forcings and efficiencies to be, on average, very similar to those reported previously. Our values for the 20-, 100- and 500-year global warming potentials are 18 000, 23 800 and 31 300, respectively.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="forster_recommendations_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Recommendations for diagnosing effective radiative forcing from climate models for CMIP6</div> <div class="author"> Piers M Forster, Thomas Richardson, Amanda C Maycock, Christopher J Smith, Bjorn H Samset, Gunnar Myhre, Timothy Andrews, Robert Pincus, and Michael Schulz </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em>, Oct 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025320" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84989215515&amp;partnerID=MN8TOARS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="12609931"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1002/2016JD025320" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The usefulness of previous Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) exercises has been hampered by a lack of radiative forcing information. This has made it difficult to understand reasons for differences between model responses. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is easier to diagnose than traditional radiative forcing in global climate models (GCMs) and is more representative of the eventual temperature response. Here we examine the different methods of computing ERF in two GCMs. We find that ERF computed from a fixed sea surface temperature (SST) method (ERF_fSST) has much more certainty than regression based methods. Thirty year integrations are sufficient to reduce the 5-95% confidence interval in global ERF_fSST to 0.1Wm-2. For 2xCO2 ERF, 30 year integrations are needed to ensure that the signal is larger than the local confidence interval over more than 90% of the globe. Within the ERF_fSST method there are various options for prescribing SSTs and sea ice. We explore these and find that ERF is only weakly dependent on the methodological choices. Prescribing the monthly averaged seasonally varying model’s preindustrial climatology is recommended for its smaller random error and easier implementation. As part of CMIP6, the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) asks models to conduct 30 year ERF_fSST experiments using the model’s own preindustrial climatology of SST and sea ice. The Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) will also mainly use this approach. We propose this as a standard method for diagnosing ERF and recommend that it be used across the climate modeling community to aid future comparisons.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="totterdill_atmospheric_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Atmospheric lifetimes, infrared absorption spectra, radiative forcings and global warming potentials of NF 3 and CF 3 CF 2 Cl (CFC-115)</div> <div class="author"> Anna Totterdill, Tamás Kovács, Wuhu Feng, Sandip Dhomse, <em>Christopher J.

The infrared cross sections are within 10 % of previous measurements for CFC-115 but are found to be somewhat larger than previous estimates for NF3, leading to a radiative efficiency for NF3 that is 25 % larger than that quoted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. A whole atmosphere chemistry–climate model was used to determine the atmospheric lifetimes of NF3 and CFC-115 to be (509 ± 21) years and (492 ± 22) years, respectively. The GWPs for NF3 are estimated to be 15 600, 19 700 and 19 700 over 20, 100 and 500 years, respectively. Similarly, the GWPs for CFC-115 are 6030, 7570 and 7480 over 20, 100 and 500 years, respectively.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_all-sky_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An all-sky radiative transfer method to predict optimal tilt and azimuth angle of a solar collector</div> <div class="author"> C J Smith, P M Forster, and R Crook </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Solar Energy</em>, Jan 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2015.11.013" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84949818624&amp;partnerID=MN8TOARS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="4837660"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1016/j.solener.2015.11.013" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper describes a radiative transfer method for calculating radiances in all-sky conditions and performing an integration over the view hemisphere of an arbitrary plane to calculate tilted irradiance. The advantage of this method is the combination of cloud parameters inside the radiative transfer model with a tilt procedure. For selected locations this method is applied with cloud, ozone, water vapour and aerosol input data to determine tilted irradiance, horizontal irradiance and optimal tilt angle. A validation is performed for horizontal and tilted irradiance against high-quality pyranometer data. For 27 sites around the world, the annual horizontal irradiation predicted by our model had a mean bias difference of +0.56% and a root-mean-squared difference of 6.69% compared to ground measurements. The difference between the annual irradiation estimates from our model and the measurements from one site that provides tilted irradiance were within ±6% for all orientations except the north-facing vertical plane. For European and African sites included in the validation, the optimal tilt from our model is typically a few degrees steeper than predictions from the popular PVGIS online tool. Our model is generally applicable to any location on the earth’s surface as the satellite cloud and atmosphere data and aerosol climatology data are available globally. Furthermore, all of the input data are standard variables in climate models and so this method can be used to predict tilted irradiance in future climate experiments</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="bright_stochastic_2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Stochastic generation of synthetic minutely irradiance time series derived from mean hourly weather observation data</div> <div class="author"> J.M.

It is necessary that they accurately capture irradiance fluctuations and variability inherent in the solar resource. This article describes a methodology to generate a synthetic minutely irradiance time series from widely available hourly weather observation data. The weather observation data are used to produce a set of Markov chains taking into account seasonal, diurnal, and pressure influences on transition probabilities of cloud cover. Cloud dynamics are based on a power-law probability distribution, from which cloud length and duration are derived. Atmospheric transmission losses are simulated with minutely variability, using atmospheric profiles from meteorological reanalysis data and cloud attenuation derived real-world observations. Both direct and diffuse irradiance are calculated, from which total irradiance is determined on an arbitrary plane. The method is applied to the city of Leeds, UK, and validated using independent hourly radiation measurements from the same site. Variability and ramp rate are validated using 1-min resolution irradiance data from the town of Cambourne, Cornwall, UK. The hourly irradiance frequency distribution correlates with whilst the mean hourly irradiance correlates with , the daily variability indices cumulative probability distribution function (CDF), 1-min irradiance ramp rate CDF and 1-min irradiance frequency CDF are also shown to correlate with , and respectively. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on 1-min data for each day show that the ramp rate frequency of occurrence is captured with a high significance level of 99.99%, whilst the irradiance frequency distribution and minutely variability indices are captured at significances of 99% and 97.5% respectively. The use of multiple Markov chains and detailed consideration of the atmospheric losses are shown to be essential elements for the generation of realistic minutely irradiance time series over a typical meteorological year. A freely downloadable example of the model is made available and may be configured to the particular requirements of users or incorporated into other models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_global_2014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Global analysis of photovoltaic energy output enhanced by phase change material cooling</div> <div class="author"> C J Smith, P M Forster, and R Crook </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Applied Energy</em>, Aug 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.083" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84899115703&amp;partnerID=MN8TOARS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">URL</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-altmetric-id="2295581"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.083" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper describes a global analysis to determine the increase in annual energy output attained by a PV system with an integrated phase change material (PCM) layer. The PCM acts as a heat sink and limits the peak temperature of the PV cell thereby increasing efficiency. The simulation uses a one-dimensional energy balance model with ambient temperature, irradiance and wind speed extracted from ERA-Interim reanalysis climate data over a 1.5° longitude 1.5° latitude global grid. The effect of varying the PCM melting temperature from 0 °C to 50 °C was investigated to identify the optimal melting temperature at each grid location. PCM-enhanced cooling is most beneficial in regions with high insolation and little intra-annual variability in climate. When using the optimal PCM melting temperature, the annual PV energy output increases by over 6% in Mexico and eastern Africa, and over 5% in many locations such as Central and South America, much of Africa, Arabia, Southern Asia and the Indonesian archipelago. In Europe, the energy output enhancement varies between 2% and nearly 5%. In general, high average ambient temperatures correlate with higher optimal PCM melting temperatures. The sensitivity to PCM melting temperature was further investigated at locations where large solar PV arrays currently exist or are planned to be constructed. Significant improvements in performance are possible even when a sub-optimal PCM melting temperature is used. A brief economic assessment based on typical material costs and energy prices shows that PCM cooling is not currently cost-effective for single-junction PV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Chris Smith.
