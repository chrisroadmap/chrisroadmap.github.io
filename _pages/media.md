## Radio and podcast interviews
- BBC Radio 5 Live, United Kingdom: on the climate policies of the two main political parties, June 2024
- FM4, Austria: on the likelihood of exceeding 1.5°C and the consequences of climate change, April 2024
- BBC Radio 4 World At One, United Kingdom: on the impacts for humanity and biodiversity if current global temperatures continue to rise, July 2023
- [BBC World Service interview on "The Climate Question"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct3kj) on the climate impact from the attack on the NordStream gas pipeline, October 2022. This was to follow up rapid analysis conducted using the [fair model](../projects/fair) in response to misconceptions that the climate impact from the released methane would be significant. [Original tweet](https://x.com/chrisroadmap/status/1575447799830904832) here

## Print and online media interviews
- [Hoe groot is de impact van methaan op de klimaatopwarming?](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/11/21/factcheck-methaan/), VRT, November 2024 [in Dutch]. I comment on the warming contribution from methane and how to reconcile different estimates provided by the IPCC and WMO.
- [How the blob was born](https://www.ethicalmarkets.com/how-the-blob-was-born/), Ethical Investor, July 2024, linking aerosol emissions reductions in China to the Pacific marine heatwave.
- [The 1.5-degree climate goal may be ‘deader than a doornail,’ and scientists are bitterly divided over it](https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/18/climate/paris-climate-goal-threatened-intl/index.html), CNN, January 2024. I was one of the scientists pushing back against Jim Hansen's claim that global warming is accelerating rapidly. 
- [Earth Was Due for Another Year of Record Warmth. But This Warm?](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/climate/global-warming-accelerating.html), New York Times, December 2023. Another piece in which I caution against using one or two extremely warm years to conclude that we had entered a new era of accelerated climate warming.
- [Climat : 2023, l'adieu à l'objectif de rester sous la barre de 1,5 °C ?](https://www.france24.com/fr/plan%C3%A8te/20230925-climat-2023-l-adieu-%C3%A0-l-objectif-de-rester-sous-la-barre-de-1-5-%C2%B0c), France 24, September 2023 [in French]. Another article in which I comment against over-interpreting one warm year in the context of the Paris Agreement.
- [The Premier League has a short haul flights crisis and Man Utd are the latest damaging culprits](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/premier-league-flights-man-utd-29328419), The Mirror, Feburary 2023. I calculate that taking a domestic flight from Newcastle to Liverpool emitted 25 times as much carbon dioxide as the team coach.

(not an exhaustive list)

## Carbon Brief
- [Guest post: The Global Methane Pledge needs to go further to help limit warming to 1.5C](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-the-global-methane-pledge-needs-to-go-further-to-help-limit-warming-to-1-5c/), November 2021
- [Guest post: The role ‘emulator’ models play in climate change projections](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-the-role-emulator-models-play-in-climate-change-projections/), September 2021
- [Cutting air pollution would not cause ‘near-term spike’ in global warming](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cutting-air-pollution-would-not-cause-near-term-spike-in-global-warming/), September 2019
- [What does revised methane data mean for the Paris Agreement?](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-does-revised-methane-date-mean-for-paris-agreement/), September 2017
