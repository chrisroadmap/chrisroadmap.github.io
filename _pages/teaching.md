## University of Leeds

Climate Change, the Physical Science Basis, 2018-2021. I led a module as part of the Climate Change and Environmental Policy MSc. This covered the basics of physical climate science including the Earth's energy balance, the greenhouse effect, radiative forcing, climate feedback and sensitivity, the carbon cycle, climate models, climate scenarios and geoengineering. I introduced students to making their own projections using the [fair simple climate model](../projects/fair).


## National Centre for Atmospheric Science

Every year from 2018-2024 I taught an introductory lecture on radiative forcing and the Earth's energy balance to new PhD students from around the UK at a week-long intensive course.
