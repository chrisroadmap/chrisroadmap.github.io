I am a senior scientist in the Water and Climate group at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium and
the [Energy, Climate and Environment Program](https://iiasa.ac.at/programs/ece) at IIASA, Austria. Until very recently I was at the University of Leeds with a short spell at the UK Met Office.

I am the lead maintainer of the [fair simple climate model](https://docs.fairmodel.net) and co-chair of the 
[radiative forcing model intercomparison project](https://rfmip.leeds.ac.uk) for [CMIP7](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7/).

I am involved in developing climate projections from socioeconomic scenarios and interested in
improving integrated assessment models by incorporating process-based climate feedbacks to build more realistic and useful climate scenarios. [See here](projects/) for full list of my current projects.

Over the years I've become involved in a broad spectrum of climate research and enjoy continuing to collaborate
in diverse topics. I'm always looking for new and exciting things to keep me busy.
