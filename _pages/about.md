If you've stumbled across this page, it's not ready yet.

<!-- I am a senior scientist in the [bclimate](https://hydr.vub.be/research-groups/bclimate) group at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium and a 
visiting scientist in the [Energy, Climate and Environment Program](https://iiasa.ac.at/programs/ece) at IIASA, Austria.

I am the lead maintainer of the [fair simple climate model](https://docs.fairmodel.net) and co-chair of the 
[radiative forcing model intercomparison project](https://rfmip.leeds.ac.uk) for [CMIP7](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7/).

I am involved in developing climate projections from socioeconomic scenarios and interested in
improving integrated assessment models by incorporating process-based climate feedbacks. 
I am also interested in understanding the Earth's energy budget and radiative forcing.

Over the years I've become involved in a broad spectrum of climate research and enjoy continuing to collaborate
in diverse topics. I'm always looking for interesting distractions from my day job.
Please reach out if you are interested in working together. -->
