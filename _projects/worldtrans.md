WorldTrans is a Horizon Europe funded project led by the Norwegian Meterological Institute and made up
of 12 instituional partners from across Europe. WorldTrans started in
December 2022 and runs for four years.

WorldTrans will develop a new transparent [integrated assessment model](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-integrated-assessment-models-are-used-to-study-climate-change/), FRIDA, based on system dynamics.
System dynamics allows us to better account for critical feedbacks in the human-Earth system, such as
how climate change affects food supply which in turn affects food prices, health, the economy, and
population dynamics. Including these feedbacks addresses an important gap in future scenario development.

Alongside developing FRIDA, WorldTrans will engage stakeholders in group modelling and decision-making.

I lead the Natural Sciences work package, ensuring that the climate and carbon cycle modules are faithful
simplified representations of more complex Earth System models and are grounded in real-world observations.
We are also developing novel climate impacts emulators for rapidly linking climate change back to the 
drivers of change in the human system.
