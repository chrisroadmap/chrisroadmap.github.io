The Scenario Compass Initiative will create a new, live and regularly updated climate scenarios database during
the period leading up to the IPCC's Seventh Assessment Report. This is a three-year project which started in 
July 2024, supported by the Bezos Earth Fund.

We will building upon lessons learned during the Sixth Assessment Report process and in particular the successful
handover established between Working Groups 1 and 3.

I co-lead the Climate and Emissions working group, ensuring annual updates of historical emissions are 
collated and used to harmonize the updated socioeconomic scenarios, providing an updated picture of 
feasible climate futures and mitigation options. Climate assessment will be performed using the 
[fair model](../fair). We will develop an open-source pipeline that quickly produces the climate assessment from emissions
scenarios submitted by integrated assessment modelling teams.
