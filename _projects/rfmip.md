The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) is a [World Climate Research Programme](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip7) endorsed community model intercomparison project (MIP) that seeks to evaluate why state-of-the-art climate models respond the way they do to different human and natural climate influences such as greenhouse gases, air pollutants, land use change, solar variability and volcanic eruptions.

In the last round of coordinated Earth System model experiments (CMIP6), RFMIP provided critical information on the energetic influence of different climate forcers over the historical period and their potential future effects. The diversity of model responses to the same aerosol emissions (figure below) can be used to train emulators such as [fair](../fair) to infer information about the Earth's climate sensitivity {% cite smith_energy_2021 %}.

For the next round of climate model experiments, I am co-chairing RFMIP with [Ryan Kramer](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ryan-kramer-homepage/) (NOAA GFDL) and [Tim Andrews](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/tim-andrews) (UK Met Office).
