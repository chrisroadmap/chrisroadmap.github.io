The Indicators of Global Climate Change will report IPCC assessments of physical climate indicators on an annual basis, around May, reporting on the previous calendar year. This fills in the gaps between IPCC-quality assessments, which occur every seven years or so, on to the timescales that policymakers require.

The Indicators does not revise IPCC methods, but updates the assessments given new observational data. Indicators is a collaboration of over 50 scientists from around the world, many of which were IPCC Sixth Assessment Report Working Group 1 authors.

I lead the updating of the effective radiative forcing assessment which follows on from my work in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Asssessment Report.
