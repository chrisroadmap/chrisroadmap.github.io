The third global [Scenarios Forum](https://scenariosforum.org) will take place from 16--18 July at the University of Leeds. 

As a participant and session leader in the second Scenarios Forum held in 2022 at IIASA, I saw the huge value of bringing together socioeconomic and climate modellers to craft the next generation of climate scenarios. There is a need to be more inclusive, more complete and more ambitious than had been done previously.

I was part of the team that successfully brought this meeting to Leeds in 2025. While I am not at the university now, I am part of the scientific organising committee for this meeting.

The call for themes is coming soon.
